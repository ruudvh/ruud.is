With this practical book, Android developers will learn how to make the transition from Java to Kotlin, including how Kotlin provides a true advantage for gaining control over asynchronous computations. Authors Pierre-Olivier Laurence, Amanda Hinchman-Dominguez, G. Blake Meike, and Mike Dunn explore implementations of the most common tasks in native Android development, and show you how Kotlin can help you solve concurrency problems. With a focus on structured concurrency, a new asynchronous programming paradigm, this book will guide you through one of Kotlin\u0027s most powerful constructs, coroutines. Learn about Kotlin essentials and the Kotlin Collections Framework Explore Android fundamentals: the operating system and the application container and its components Learn about thread safety and how to handle concurrency Write sequential, asynchronous work at a low cost Examine structured concurrency with coroutines, and learn how channels make coroutines communicate Learn how to use flows for asynchronous data processing Understand performance considerations using Android profiling tools Use performance optimizations to trim resource consumption\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e", "custom_clean": 1, "custom_lists": [{"id": 10, "sort": "Programming.Kotlin", "value": "Programming.Kotlin"}], "custom_lists_ids": "10", "custom_read_date": null, "custom_reading_list": 0, "custom_types": "eBook", "flags": 1, "has_cover": 1, "id": 349, "identifier_ids": "1140,1137,1139,1138", "identifiers": [{"book": 349, "id": 1138, "name": "ISBN", "path": "https://www.worldcat.org/isbn/9781492063001", "sort": "isbn", "type": "isbn", "val": "9781492063001"}, {"book": 349, "id": 1139, "name": "Google Books", "path": "https://books.google.com/books?id=59MrzgEACAAJ", "sort": "google", "type": "google", "val": "59MrzgEACAAJ"}, {"book": 349, "id": 1137, "name": "Goodreads", "path": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/56850126", "sort": "goodreads", "type": "goodreads", "val": "56850126"}, {"book": 349, "id": 1140, "name": "Amazon", "path": "https://amazon.com/dp/1492063002", "sort": "amazon", "type": "amazon", "val": "1492063002"}], "isbn": "9781492063001", "language_ids": "1", "languages": [{"avg_rating": 8.429245283018869, "count": 341, "id": 1, "name": "ENG", "sort": "ENG"}], "last_modified": "2023-05-25 10:49:15.038284+00:00", "order_by": "2023-05-25 10:15:35.419757+00:00", "path": "Pierre-Olivier Laurence/Programming Android With Kotlin_ Ac (349)", "pubdate": "2021-05-15", "publisher_ids": "140", "publishers": [{"avg_rating": 9.333333333333334, "count": 4, "id": 140, "name": "O\u0027Reilly Media", "sort": "O\u0027Reilly Media"}], "rating": 5, "series": [], "series_ids": null, "size": 3267519, "tag_ids": "190,339,340,348,349,360,361", "tags": [{"avg_rating": 8.461538461538462, "count": 47, "id": 349, "name": "General", "sort": 47}, {"avg_rating": 7.714285714285714, "count": 30, "id": 190, "name": "Programming", "sort": 30}, {"avg_rating": 7.538461538461538, "count": 18, "id": 339, "name": "Computers", "sort": 18}, {"avg_rating": 8.857142857142858, "count": 11, "id": 348, "name": "Languages", "sort": 11}, {"avg_rating": 7.428571428571429, "count": 8, "id": 361, "name": "Android", "sort": 8}, {"avg_rating": 7.428571428571429, "count": 7, "id": 360, "name": "Operating Systems", "sort": 7}, {"avg_rating": 6.666666666666667, "count": 5, "id": 340, "name": "Mobile Devices", "sort": 5}], "timestamp": "2023-05-25 10:15:35.419757+00:00", "title": "Programming Android With Kotlin: Achieving Structured Concurrency With Coroutines"}, {"author_ids": "406,407", "authors": [{"avg_rating": 10.0, "count": 1, "id": 407, "name": "Massimo Carli", "sort": "Carli, Massimo"}, {"avg_rating": 10.0, "count": 1, "id": 406, "name": "Raywenderlich Tutorial Team", "sort": "Raywenderlich Tutorial Team"}], "comments": "\u003cdiv\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLearn Functional Programming!\u003cbr\u003eFunctional programming can feel like an academic topic: category theory and monads and monoids, oh my!

From the prize-winning and bestselling author of Say Nothing The history of the Sackler dynasty is rife with drama\u2014baroque personal lives; bitter disputes over estates; fistfights in boardrooms; glittering art collections; Machiavellian courtroom maneuvers; and the calculated use of money to burnish reputations and crush the less powerful.\u00a0The Sackler name has adorned the walls of many storied institutions\u2014Harvard, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Oxford, the Louvre. They are one of the richest families in the world, known for their lavish donations to the arts and the sciences. The source of the family fortune was vague, however, until it emerged that the Sacklers were responsible for making and marketing a blockbuster painkiller that was the catalyst for the opioid crisis. Empire of Pain begins with the story of three doctor brothers, Raymond, Mortimer and the incalculably energetic Arthur, who weathered the poverty of the Great Depression and appalling anti-Semitism. Working at a barbaric mental institution, Arthur saw a better way and conducted groundbreaking research into drug treatments. He also had a genius for marketing, especially for pharmaceuticals, and bought a small ad firm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eArthur devised the marketing for Valium, and built the first great Sackler fortune. He purchased a drug manufacturer, Purdue Frederick, which would be run by Raymond and Mortimer. The brothers began collecting art, and wives, and grand residences in exotic locales. Their children and grandchildren grew up in luxury.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eForty years later, Raymond\u2019s son Richard ran the family-owned Purdue. The template Arthur Sackler created to sell Valium\u2014co-opting doctors, influencing the FDA, downplaying the drug\u2019s addictiveness\u2014was employed to launch a far more potent product: OxyContin. The drug went on to generate some thirty-five billion dollars in revenue, and to launch a public health crisis in which hundreds of thousands would die. This is the saga of three generations of a single family and the mark they would leave on the world, a tale that moves from the bustling streets of early twentieth-century Brooklyn to the seaside palaces\u00a0of Greenwich, Connecticut, and Cap d\u2019Antibes to the corridors of power in Washington, D.C.\u00a0 Empire of Pain chronicles the multiple investigations of the Sacklers and their company, and the scorched-earth legal tactics that the family has used to evade accountability.\u00a0Empire of Pain is a masterpiece of narrative reporting and writing, exhaustively documented and ferociously compelling. It is a portrait of the excesses of America\u2019s second Gilded Age, a study of impunity among the super elite and a relentless investigation of the naked greed and indifference to human suffering that built one of the world\u2019s great fortunes.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e", "custom_clean": 1, "custom_lists": [{"id": 5, "sort": "Must Read.2021 Time", "value": "Must Read.2021 Time"}], "custom_lists_ids": "5", "custom_read_date": null, "custom_reading_list": 0, "custom_types": "eBook", "flags": 1, "has_cover": 1, "id": 124, "identifier_ids": "408,406,407", "identifiers": [{"book": 124, "id": 407, "name": "ISBN", "path": "https://www.worldcat.org/isbn/9780385545693", "sort": "isbn", "type": "isbn", "val": "9780385545693"}, {"book": 124, "id": 406, "name": "Google Books", "path": "https://books.google.com/books?id=Qb4IEAAAQBAJ", "sort": "google", "type": "google", "val": "Qb4IEAAAQBAJ"}, {"book": 124, "id": 408, "name": "Goodreads", "path": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43868109", "sort": "goodreads", "type": "goodreads", "val": "43868109"}], "isbn": "9780385545693", "language_ids": "1", "languages": [{"avg_rating": 8.429245283018869, "count": 341, "id": 1, "name": "ENG", "sort": "ENG"}], "last_modified": "2023-05-04 17:55:52.136675+00:00", "order_by": "2022-10-05 15:54:07.602947+00:00", "path": "Patrick Radden Keefe/Empire of Pain_ The Secret History (124)", "pubdate": "2021-04-13", "publisher_ids": "82", "publishers": [{"avg_rating": 8.5, "count": 5, "id": 82, "name": "Knopf Publishing Group", "sort": "Knopf Publishing Group"}], "rating": 5, "series": [], "series_ids": null, "size": 5759595, "tag_ids": "51,57,58,60,92,194", "tags": [{"avg_rating": 8.333333333333334, "count": 40, "id": 194, "name": "Time", "sort": 40}, {"avg_rating": 8.222222222222221, "count": 31, "id": 92, "name": "Biography", "sort": 31}, {"avg_rating": 8.363636363636363, "count": 24, "id": 60, "name": "History", "sort": 24}, {"avg_rating": 8.347826086956522, "count": 23, "id": 57, "name": "Politics", "sort": 23}, {"avg_rating": 8.2, "count": 11, "id": 51, "name": "Business", "sort": 11}, {"avg_rating": 8.222222222222221, "count": 11, "id": 58, "name": "Science", "sort": 11}], "timestamp": "2022-10-05 15:54:07.602947+00:00", "title": "Empire of Pain: The Secret History of the Sackler Dynasty"}, {"author_ids": "123", "authors": [{"avg_rating": 10.0, "count": 1, "id": 123, "name": "Tarana Burke", "sort": "Burke, Tarana"}], "comments": "\u003cdiv\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom the founder and activist behind one of the largest movements of the twentieth and twenty-first centuries, the \"me too\" movement, Tarana Burke debuts a powerful memoir about her own journey to saying those two simple yet infinitely powerful words\u2015me too\u2015and how she brought empathy back to an entire generation in one of the largest cultural events in American history.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTarana didn\u2019t always have the courage to say \"me too.\" As a child, she reeled from her sexual assault, believing she was responsible.

Beginning in his hometown of New Orleans, Clint Smith leads the reader on an unforgettable tour of monuments and landmarks--those that are honest about the past and those that are not--that offer an intergenerational story of how slavery has been central in shaping our nation\u0027s collective history, and ourselves. It is the story of the Monticello Plantation in Virginia, the estate where Thomas Jefferson wrote letters espousing the urgent need for liberty while enslaving more than four hundred people. It is the story of the Whitney Plantation, one of the only former plantations devoted to preserving the experience of the enslaved people whose lives and work sustained it. It is the story of Angola, a former plantation-turned-maximum-security prison in Louisiana that is filled with Black men who work across the 18,000-acre land for virtually no pay. And it is the story of Blandford Cemetery, the final resting place of tens of thousands of Confederate soldiers. A deeply researched and transporting exploration of the legacy of slavery and its imprint on centuries of American history, How the Word Is Passed illustrates how some of our country\u0027s most essential stories are hidden in plain view--whether in places we might drive by on our way to work, holidays such as Juneteenth, or entire neighborhoods like downtown Manhattan, where the brutal history of the trade in enslaved men, women, and children has been deeply imprinted. Informed by scholarship and brought to life by the story of people living today, Smith\u0027s debut work of nonfiction is a landmark of reflection and insight that offers a new understanding of the hopeful role that memory and history can play in making sense of our country and how it has come to be.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e", "custom_clean": 1, "custom_lists": [{"id": 5, "sort": "Must Read.2021 Time", "value": "Must Read.2021 Time"}], "custom_lists_ids": "5", "custom_read_date": null, "custom_reading_list": 0, "custom_types": "eBook", "flags": 1, "has_cover": 1, "id": 113, "identifier_ids": "374,376,375,377", "identifiers": [{"book": 113, "id": 377, "name": "ISBN", "path": "https://www.worldcat.org/isbn/9780316492935", "sort": "isbn", "type": "isbn", "val": "9780316492935"}, {"book": 113, "id": 375, "name": "Google Books", "path": "https://books.google.com/books?id=8pEHzgEACAAJ", "sort": "google", "type": "google", "val": "8pEHzgEACAAJ"}, {"book": 113, "id": 376, "name": "Goodreads", "path": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/55643287", "sort": "goodreads", "type": "goodreads", "val": "55643287"}, {"book": 113, "id": 374, "name": "Amazon", "path": "https://amazon.com/dp/0316492930", "sort": "amazon", "type": "amazon", "val": "0316492930"}], "isbn": "9780316492935", "language_ids": "1", "languages": [{"avg_rating": 8.429245283018869, "count": 341, "id": 1, "name": "ENG", "sort": "ENG"}], "last_modified": "2023-05-04 17:55:52.136675+00:00", "order_by": "2022-10-05 15:54:03.677102+00:00", "path": "Clint Smith/How the Word Is Passed_ A Reckoning (113)", "pubdate": "2021-06-01", "publisher_ids": "68", "publishers": [{"avg_rating": 8.5, "count": 4, "id": 68, "name": "Little, Brown and Company", "sort": "Little, Brown and Company"}], "rating": 5, "series": [], "series_ids": null, "size": 568333, "tag_ids": "57,60,194", "tags": [{"avg_rating": 8.333333333333334, "count": 40, "id": 194, "name": "Time", "sort": 40}, {"avg_rating": 8.363636363636363, "count": 24, "id": 60, "name": "History", "sort": 24}, {"avg_rating": 8.347826086956522, "count": 23, "id": 57, "name": "Politics", "sort": 23}], "timestamp": "2022-10-05 15:54:03.677102+00:00", "title": "How the Word Is Passed: A Reckoning With the History of Slavery Across America"}, {"author_ids": "114", "authors": [{"avg_rating": 10.0, "count": 1, "id": 114, "name": "Andrea Elliott", "sort": "Elliott, Andrea"}], "comments": "\u003cdiv\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn Invisible Child, Pulitzer Prize winner Andrea Elliott follows eight dramatic years in the life of Dasani, a girl whose imagination is as soaring as the skyscrapers near her Brooklyn shelter.

Now, as the brutal struggle for power nears its tumultuous climax, the battered and divided kingdom faces its most terrifying invasion\u2014one that is being spearheaded from beyond the grave....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA STORM OF SWORDS\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf the five contenders for power, one is dead, another in disfavor, and still the wars rage as violently as ever, as alliances are made and broken. Joffrey, of House Lannister, sits on the Iron Throne, the uneasy ruler of the land of the Seven Kingdoms. His most bitter rival, Lord Stannis, stands defeated and disgraced, the victim of the jealous sorceress who holds him in her evil thrall. But young Robb, of House Stark, still rules the North from the fortress of Riverrun. Robb plots against his despised Lannister enemies, even as they hold his sister hostage at King\u0027s Landing, the seat of the Iron Throne. Meanwhile, making her way across a blood-drenched continent is the exiled queen, Daenerys, mistress of the only three dragons still left in the world. Filled with the stench of death and decay from the destructive dynastic war, Daenerys is gathering allies and strength for an assault on King\u0027s Landing, hoping to win back the crown she believes is rightfully hers. But as opposing forces maneuver for the final titanic showdown, an army of barbaric wildlings bent on overwhelming the Seven Kingdoms arrives from the outermost line of civilization. In their vanguard is a horde of mythical Others\u2014a supernatural army of the living dead whose animated corpses are unstoppable. And as the future of the land hangs in the balance, no one will rest in the quest for victory until the Seven Kingdoms have exploded in a veritable storm of swords.... Brilliantly conceived and grand in scope, A Storm of Swords is the incredible tale of a world of harsh beauty and powerful magic, torn by treachery, ravaged by brutality, and consumed by greed and ambition. It portrays a war-torn landscape in which nobles and commoners, heroes and villains, the freeborn and the enslaved, all struggle to survive and to find their destinies...along with the dazzling bounty and wondrous enchantment that was once their birthright in the Seven Kingdoms.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e", "custom_clean": 1, "custom_lists": [], "custom_lists_ids": null, "custom_read_date": null, "custom_reading_list": 0, "custom_types": "eBook", "flags": 1, "has_cover": 1, "id": 79, "identifier_ids": "183,184,181,182,180", "identifiers": [{"book": 79, "id": 180, "name": "ISBN", "path": "https://www.worldcat.org/isbn/9780553106633", "sort": "isbn", "type": "isbn", "val": "9780553106633"}, {"book": 79, "id": 182, "name": "Google Books", "path": "https://books.google.com/books?id=YxpbAAAAMAAJ", "sort": "google", "type": "google", "val": "YxpbAAAAMAAJ"}, {"book": 79, "id": 181, "name": "Goodreads", "path": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10396652", "sort": "goodreads", "type": "goodreads", "val": "10396652"}, {"book": 79, "id": 184, "name": "Barnes \u0026 Noble", "path": "https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/storm-of-swords-george-r-r-martin/1100179865", "sort": "barnesnoble", "type": "barnesnoble", "val": "w/storm-of-swords-george-r-r-martin/1100179865"}, {"book": 79, "id": 183, "name": "Amazon", "path": "https://amazon.com/dp/0553106635", "sort": "amazon", "type": "amazon", "val": "0553106635"}], "isbn": "9780553106633", "language_ids": "1", "languages": [{"avg_rating": 8.429245283018869, "count": 341, "id": 1, "name": "ENG", "sort": "ENG"}], "last_modified": "2022-10-06 17:19:38.709950+00:00", "order_by": "2022-10-04 19:44:41.482947+00:00", "path": "George R.R.

With A Game of Thrones, George R. R. Martin has launched a genuine masterpiece, bringing together the best the genre has to offer. Mystery, intrigue, romance, and adventure fill the pages of this magnificent saga, the first volume in an epic series sure to delight fantasy fans everywhere.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLong ago, in a time forgotten, a preternatural event threw the seasons out of balance. In a land where summers can last decades and winters a lifetime, trouble is brewing. The cold is returning, and in the frozen wastes to the north of Winterfell, sinister forces are massing beyond the kingdom\u0027s protective Wall. To the south, the king\u0027s powers are failing--his most trusted adviser dead under mysterious circumstances and his enemies emerging from the shadows of the throne. At the center of the conflict lie the Starks of Winterfell, a family as harsh and unyielding as the frozen land they were born to. Now Lord Eddard Stark is reluctantly summoned to serve as the king\u0027s new Hand, an appointment that threatens to sunder not only his family but the kingdom itself. Sweeping from a harsh land of cold to a summertime kingdom of epicurean plenty, A Game of Thrones tells a tale of lords and ladies, soldiers and sorcerers, assassins and bastards, who come together in a time of grim omens. Here an enigmatic band of warriors bear swords of no human metal; a tribe of fierce wildlings carry men off into madness; a cruel young dragon prince barters his sister to win back his thro\u2260 a child is lost in the twilight between life and death; and a determined woman undertakes a treacherous journey to protect all she holds dear. Amid plots and counter-plots, tragedy and betrayal, victory and terror, allies and enemies, the fate of the Starks hangs perilously in the balance, as each side endeavors to win that deadliest of conflicts: the game of thrones. Unparalleled in scope and execution, A Game of Thrones is one of those rare reading experiences that catch you up from the opening pages, won\u0027t let you go until the end, and leave you yearning for more.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e", "custom_clean": 1, "custom_lists": [], "custom_lists_ids": null, "custom_read_date": null, "custom_reading_list": 0, "custom_types": "eBook", "flags": 1, "has_cover": 1, "id": 77, "identifier_ids": "193,194,192,190,191", "identifiers": [{"book": 77, "id": 191, "name": "ISBN", "path": "https://www.worldcat.org/isbn/9780553103540", "sort": "isbn", "type": "isbn", "val": "9780553103540"}, {"book": 77, "id": 190, "name": "Google Books", "path": "https://books.google.com/books?id=5qNtQgAACAAJ", "sort": "google", "type": "google", "val": "5qNtQgAACAAJ"}, {"book": 77, "id": 192, "name": "Goodreads", "path": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38451264", "sort": "goodreads", "type": "goodreads", "val": "38451264"}, {"book": 77, "id": 194, "name": "Barnes \u0026 Noble", "path": "https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/game-of-thrones-george-r-r-martin/1100041703", "sort": "barnesnoble", "type": "barnesnoble", "val": "w/game-of-thrones-george-r-r-martin/1100041703"}, {"book": 77, "id": 193, "name": "Amazon", "path": "https://amazon.com/dp/0553103547", "sort": "amazon", "type": "amazon", "val": "0553103547"}], "isbn": "9780553103540", "language_ids": "1", "languages": [{"avg_rating": 8.429245283018869, "count": 341, "id": 1, "name": "ENG", "sort": "ENG"}], "last_modified": "2022-10-06 17:19:38.709950+00:00", "order_by": "2022-10-04 19:44:41.131884+00:00", "path": "George R.R.

And so when Lord Ventinari, the city\u0027s benevolent tyrant, strongly suggests to Archchancellor Mustrum Ridcully that the university revive an erstwhile tradition and once again put forth a football team composed of faculty, students, and staff, the wizards of UU find themselves in a quandary. To begin with, they have to figure out just what it is that makes this sport\u2014soccer with a bit of rugby thrown in\u2014so popular with Ankh-Morporkians of all ages and social strata. Then they have to learn how to play it. Oh, and on top of that, they must win a football match without using magic. Meanwhile, Trev (a handsome street urchin and a right good kicker) falls hard for kitchen maid Juliet (beautiful, dim, and perhaps the greatest fashion model there ever was), and Juliet\u0027s best pal, UU night cook Glenda (homely, sensible, and a baker of jolly good pies) befriends the mysterious Mr. Nutt (about whom no one knows very much, including Mr. Nutt, which is worrisome ...).

Yet people face increasing distractions or social pressure that drive them toward shallow work. Newport develops his ideas with a blend of formal research, stories and personal accounts about the challenges and rewards of deep work. He provides tips for arranging your life to support deep work, which he sees as valuable, productive and rare.

Out of their trials and their repeated collisions against the hard realities of an America divided into Haves and Have-Nots evolves a drama that is intensely human yet majestic in its scale and moral vision, elemental yet plainspoken, tragic but ultimately stirring in its human dignity. A portrait of the conflict between the powerful and the powerless, of one man\u2019s fierce reaction to injustice, and of one woman\u2019s stoical strength, the novel captures the horrors of the Great Depression and probes into the very nature of equality and justice in America. At once a naturalistic epic, captivity narrative, road novel, and transcendental gospel, Steinbeck\u2019s powerful landmark novel is perhaps the most American of American Classics. \u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e", "custom_clean": 1, "custom_lists": [{"id": 14, "sort": "Must Read.25 Must Read", "value": "Must Read.25 Must Read"}], "custom_lists_ids": "14", "custom_read_date": null, "custom_reading_list": 0, "custom_types": "eBook", "flags": 1, "has_cover": 1, "id": 446, "identifier_ids": "1239,1238,1240", "identifiers": [{"book": 446, "id": 1240, "name": "ISBN", "path": "https://www.worldcat.org/isbn/9780143039433", "sort": "isbn", "type": "isbn", "val": "9780143039433"}, {"book": 446, "id": 1238, "name": "Google Books", "path": "https://books.google.com/books?id=bhJgd3hGdxQC", "sort": "google", "type": "google", "val": "bhJgd3hGdxQC"}, {"book": 446, "id": 1239, "name": "Amazon", "path": "https://amazon.com/dp/0143039431", "sort": "amazon", "type": "amazon", "val": "0143039431"}], "isbn": "9780143039433", "language_ids": "1", "languages": [{"avg_rating": 8.429245283018869, "count": 341, "id": 1, "name": "ENG", "sort": "ENG"}], "last_modified": "2023-07-21 14:32:47.527874+00:00", "order_by": "2020-03-03 23:00:00+00:00", "path": "John Steinbeck/The Grapes of Wrath (446)", "pubdate": "2006-03-27", "publisher_ids": "90", "publishers": [{"avg_rating": 8.8, "count": 20, "id": 90, "name": "Penguin Random House", "sort": "Penguin Random House"}], "rating": 5, "series": [], "series_ids": null, "size": 1950305, "tag_ids": "4,148,152,153,349,400,401,402,403,404,405,406,407", "tags": [{"avg_rating": 9.25, "count": 97, "id": 4, "name": "Fiction", "sort": 97}, {"avg_rating": 8.461538461538462, "count": 47, "id": 349, "name": "General", "sort": 47}, {"avg_rating": 8.578947368421053, "count": 28, "id": 153, "name": "Classics", "sort": 28}, {"avg_rating": 9.0, "count": 11, "id": 152, "name": "Literary", "sort": 11}, {"avg_rating": 9.333333333333334, "count": 5, "id": 148, "name": "Historical", "sort": 5}, {"avg_rating": 10.0, "count": 1, "id": 400, "name": "Domestic fiction", "sort": 1}, {"avg_rating": 10.0, "count": 1, "id": 401, "name": "Political fiction", "sort": 1}, {"avg_rating": 10.0, "count": 1, "id": 402, "name": "California", "sort": 1}, {"avg_rating": 10.0, "count": 1, "id": 403, "name": "Rural families", "sort": 1}, {"avg_rating": 10.0, "count": 1, "id": 404, "name": "Migrant agricultural laborers", "sort": 1}, {"avg_rating": 10.0, "count": 1, "id": 405, "name": "Depressions", "sort": 1}, {"avg_rating": 10.0, "count": 1, "id": 406, "name": "Labor camps", "sort": 1}, {"avg_rating": 10.0, "count": 1, "id": 407, "name": "Oklahoma", "sort": 1}], "timestamp": "2020-03-03 23:00:00+00:00", "title": "The Grapes of Wrath"}, {"author_ids": "464", "authors": [{"avg_rating": 10.0, "count": 1, "id": 464, "name": "Khaled Hosseini", "sort": "Hosseini, khaled"}], "comments": "\u003cdiv\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe unforgettable, heartbreaking story of the unlikely friendship between a wealthy boy and the son of his father\u2019s servant, caught in the tragic sweep of history, \u003cem\u003eThe Kite Runner\u003c/em\u003e transports readers to Afghanistan at a tense and crucial moment of change and destruction.

With this practical book, Android developers will learn how to make the transition from Java to Kotlin, including how Kotlin provides a true advantage for gaining control over asynchronous computations. Authors Pierre-Olivier Laurence, Amanda Hinchman-Dominguez, G. Blake Meike, and Mike Dunn explore implementations of the most common tasks in native Android development, and show you how Kotlin can help you solve concurrency problems. With a focus on structured concurrency, a new asynchronous programming paradigm, this book will guide you through one of Kotlin\u0027s most powerful constructs, coroutines. Learn about Kotlin essentials and the Kotlin Collections Framework Explore Android fundamentals: the operating system and the application container and its components Learn about thread safety and how to handle concurrency Write sequential, asynchronous work at a low cost Examine structured concurrency with coroutines, and learn how channels make coroutines communicate Learn how to use flows for asynchronous data processing Understand performance considerations using Android profiling tools Use performance optimizations to trim resource consumption\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e", "custom_clean": 1, "custom_lists": [{"id": 10, "sort": "Programming.Kotlin", "value": "Programming.Kotlin"}], "custom_lists_ids": "10", "custom_read_date": null, "custom_reading_list": 0, "custom_types": "eBook", "flags": 1, "has_cover": 1, "id": 349, "identifier_ids": "1140,1137,1139,1138", "identifiers": [{"book": 349, "id": 1138, "name": "ISBN", "path": "https://www.worldcat.org/isbn/9781492063001", "sort": "isbn", "type": "isbn", "val": "9781492063001"}, {"book": 349, "id": 1139, "name": "Google Books", "path": "https://books.google.com/books?id=59MrzgEACAAJ", "sort": "google", "type": "google", "val": "59MrzgEACAAJ"}, {"book": 349, "id": 1137, "name": "Goodreads", "path": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/56850126", "sort": "goodreads", "type": "goodreads", "val": "56850126"}, {"book": 349, "id": 1140, "name": "Amazon", "path": "https://amazon.com/dp/1492063002", "sort": "amazon", "type": "amazon", "val": "1492063002"}], "isbn": "9781492063001", "language_ids": "1", "languages": [{"avg_rating": 8.429245283018869, "count": 341, "id": 1, "name": "ENG", "sort": "ENG"}], "last_modified": "2023-05-25 10:49:15.038284+00:00", "order_by": "2023-05-25 10:15:35.419757+00:00", "path": "Pierre-Olivier Laurence/Programming Android With Kotlin_ Ac (349)", "pubdate": "2021-05-15", "publisher_ids": "140", "publishers": [{"avg_rating": 9.333333333333334, "count": 4, "id": 140, "name": "O\u0027Reilly Media", "sort": "O\u0027Reilly Media"}], "rating": 5, "series": [], "series_ids": null, "size": 3267519, "tag_ids": "190,339,340,348,349,360,361", "tags": [{"avg_rating": 8.461538461538462, "count": 47, "id": 349, "name": "General", "sort": 47}, {"avg_rating": 7.714285714285714, "count": 30, "id": 190, "name": "Programming", "sort": 30}, {"avg_rating": 7.538461538461538, "count": 18, "id": 339, "name": "Computers", "sort": 18}, {"avg_rating": 8.857142857142858, "count": 11, "id": 348, "name": "Languages", "sort": 11}, {"avg_rating": 7.428571428571429, "count": 8, "id": 361, "name": "Android", "sort": 8}, {"avg_rating": 7.428571428571429, "count": 7, "id": 360, "name": "Operating Systems", "sort": 7}, {"avg_rating": 6.666666666666667, "count": 5, "id": 340, "name": "Mobile Devices", "sort": 5}], "timestamp": "2023-05-25 10:15:35.419757+00:00", "title": "Programming Android With Kotlin: Achieving Structured Concurrency With Coroutines"}, {"author_ids": "406,407", "authors": [{"avg_rating": 10.0, "count": 1, "id": 407, "name": "Massimo Carli", "sort": "Carli, Massimo"}, {"avg_rating": 10.0, "count": 1, "id": 406, "name": "Raywenderlich Tutorial Team", "sort": "Raywenderlich Tutorial Team"}], "comments": "\u003cdiv\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLearn Functional Programming!\u003cbr\u003eFunctional programming can feel like an academic topic: category theory and monads and monoids, oh my!

This is the story of how public goods in this country--from parks and pools to functioning schools--have become private luxuries; of how unions collapsed, wages stagnated, and inequality increased; and of how this country, unique among the world\u0027s advanced economies, has thwarted universal healthcare.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut in unlikely places of worship and work, McGhee finds proof of what she calls the Solidarity Dividend: gains that come when people come together across race, to accomplish what we simply can\u0027t do on our own.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMcGhee marshals economic and sociological research to paint a story of racism\u0027s costs, but at the heart of the book are the humble stories of people yearning to be part of a better America, including white supremacy\u0027s collateral victims: white people themselves.

From the prize-winning and bestselling author of Say Nothing The history of the Sackler dynasty is rife with drama\u2014baroque personal lives; bitter disputes over estates; fistfights in boardrooms; glittering art collections; Machiavellian courtroom maneuvers; and the calculated use of money to burnish reputations and crush the less powerful.\u00a0The Sackler name has adorned the walls of many storied institutions\u2014Harvard, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Oxford, the Louvre. They are one of the richest families in the world, known for their lavish donations to the arts and the sciences. The source of the family fortune was vague, however, until it emerged that the Sacklers were responsible for making and marketing a blockbuster painkiller that was the catalyst for the opioid crisis. Empire of Pain begins with the story of three doctor brothers, Raymond, Mortimer and the incalculably energetic Arthur, who weathered the poverty of the Great Depression and appalling anti-Semitism. Working at a barbaric mental institution, Arthur saw a better way and conducted groundbreaking research into drug treatments. He also had a genius for marketing, especially for pharmaceuticals, and bought a small ad firm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eArthur devised the marketing for Valium, and built the first great Sackler fortune. He purchased a drug manufacturer, Purdue Frederick, which would be run by Raymond and Mortimer. The brothers began collecting art, and wives, and grand residences in exotic locales. Their children and grandchildren grew up in luxury.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eForty years later, Raymond\u2019s son Richard ran the family-owned Purdue. The template Arthur Sackler created to sell Valium\u2014co-opting doctors, influencing the FDA, downplaying the drug\u2019s addictiveness\u2014was employed to launch a far more potent product: OxyContin. The drug went on to generate some thirty-five billion dollars in revenue, and to launch a public health crisis in which hundreds of thousands would die. This is the saga of three generations of a single family and the mark they would leave on the world, a tale that moves from the bustling streets of early twentieth-century Brooklyn to the seaside palaces\u00a0of Greenwich, Connecticut, and Cap d\u2019Antibes to the corridors of power in Washington, D.C.\u00a0 Empire of Pain chronicles the multiple investigations of the Sacklers and their company, and the scorched-earth legal tactics that the family has used to evade accountability.\u00a0Empire of Pain is a masterpiece of narrative reporting and writing, exhaustively documented and ferociously compelling. It is a portrait of the excesses of America\u2019s second Gilded Age, a study of impunity among the super elite and a relentless investigation of the naked greed and indifference to human suffering that built one of the world\u2019s great fortunes.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e", "custom_clean": 1, "custom_lists": [{"id": 5, "sort": "Must Read.2021 Time", "value": "Must Read.2021 Time"}], "custom_lists_ids": "5", "custom_read_date": null, "custom_reading_list": 0, "custom_types": "eBook", "flags": 1, "has_cover": 1, "id": 124, "identifier_ids": "408,406,407", "identifiers": [{"book": 124, "id": 407, "name": "ISBN", "path": "https://www.worldcat.org/isbn/9780385545693", "sort": "isbn", "type": "isbn", "val": "9780385545693"}, {"book": 124, "id": 406, "name": "Google Books", "path": "https://books.google.com/books?id=Qb4IEAAAQBAJ", "sort": "google", "type": "google", "val": "Qb4IEAAAQBAJ"}, {"book": 124, "id": 408, "name": "Goodreads", "path": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43868109", "sort": "goodreads", "type": "goodreads", "val": "43868109"}], "isbn": "9780385545693", "language_ids": "1", "languages": [{"avg_rating": 8.429245283018869, "count": 341, "id": 1, "name": "ENG", "sort": "ENG"}], "last_modified": "2023-05-04 17:55:52.136675+00:00", "order_by": "2022-10-05 15:54:07.602947+00:00", "path": "Patrick Radden Keefe/Empire of Pain_ The Secret History (124)", "pubdate": "2021-04-13", "publisher_ids": "82", "publishers": [{"avg_rating": 8.5, "count": 5, "id": 82, "name": "Knopf Publishing Group", "sort": "Knopf Publishing Group"}], "rating": 5, "series": [], "series_ids": null, "size": 5759595, "tag_ids": "51,57,58,60,92,194", "tags": [{"avg_rating": 8.333333333333334, "count": 40, "id": 194, "name": "Time", "sort": 40}, {"avg_rating": 8.222222222222221, "count": 31, "id": 92, "name": "Biography", "sort": 31}, {"avg_rating": 8.363636363636363, "count": 24, "id": 60, "name": "History", "sort": 24}, {"avg_rating": 8.347826086956522, "count": 23, "id": 57, "name": "Politics", "sort": 23}, {"avg_rating": 8.2, "count": 11, "id": 51, "name": "Business", "sort": 11}, {"avg_rating": 8.222222222222221, "count": 11, "id": 58, "name": "Science", "sort": 11}], "timestamp": "2022-10-05 15:54:07.602947+00:00", "title": "Empire of Pain: The Secret History of the Sackler Dynasty"}, {"author_ids": "123", "authors": [{"avg_rating": 10.0, "count": 1, "id": 123, "name": "Tarana Burke", "sort": "Burke, Tarana"}], "comments": "\u003cdiv\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom the founder and activist behind one of the largest movements of the twentieth and twenty-first centuries, the \"me too\" movement, Tarana Burke debuts a powerful memoir about her own journey to saying those two simple yet infinitely powerful words\u2015me too\u2015and how she brought empathy back to an entire generation in one of the largest cultural events in American history.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTarana didn\u2019t always have the courage to say \"me too.\" As a child, she reeled from her sexual assault, believing she was responsible.

Beginning in his hometown of New Orleans, Clint Smith leads the reader on an unforgettable tour of monuments and landmarks--those that are honest about the past and those that are not--that offer an intergenerational story of how slavery has been central in shaping our nation\u0027s collective history, and ourselves. It is the story of the Monticello Plantation in Virginia, the estate where Thomas Jefferson wrote letters espousing the urgent need for liberty while enslaving more than four hundred people. It is the story of the Whitney Plantation, one of the only former plantations devoted to preserving the experience of the enslaved people whose lives and work sustained it. It is the story of Angola, a former plantation-turned-maximum-security prison in Louisiana that is filled with Black men who work across the 18,000-acre land for virtually no pay. And it is the story of Blandford Cemetery, the final resting place of tens of thousands of Confederate soldiers. A deeply researched and transporting exploration of the legacy of slavery and its imprint on centuries of American history, How the Word Is Passed illustrates how some of our country\u0027s most essential stories are hidden in plain view--whether in places we might drive by on our way to work, holidays such as Juneteenth, or entire neighborhoods like downtown Manhattan, where the brutal history of the trade in enslaved men, women, and children has been deeply imprinted. Informed by scholarship and brought to life by the story of people living today, Smith\u0027s debut work of nonfiction is a landmark of reflection and insight that offers a new understanding of the hopeful role that memory and history can play in making sense of our country and how it has come to be.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e", "custom_clean": 1, "custom_lists": [{"id": 5, "sort": "Must Read.2021 Time", "value": "Must Read.2021 Time"}], "custom_lists_ids": "5", "custom_read_date": null, "custom_reading_list": 0, "custom_types": "eBook", "flags": 1, "has_cover": 1, "id": 113, "identifier_ids": "374,376,375,377", "identifiers": [{"book": 113, "id": 377, "name": "ISBN", "path": "https://www.worldcat.org/isbn/9780316492935", "sort": "isbn", "type": "isbn", "val": "9780316492935"}, {"book": 113, "id": 375, "name": "Google Books", "path": "https://books.google.com/books?id=8pEHzgEACAAJ", "sort": "google", "type": "google", "val": "8pEHzgEACAAJ"}, {"book": 113, "id": 376, "name": "Goodreads", "path": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/55643287", "sort": "goodreads", "type": "goodreads", "val": "55643287"}, {"book": 113, "id": 374, "name": "Amazon", "path": "https://amazon.com/dp/0316492930", "sort": "amazon", "type": "amazon", "val": "0316492930"}], "isbn": "9780316492935", "language_ids": "1", "languages": [{"avg_rating": 8.429245283018869, "count": 341, "id": 1, "name": "ENG", "sort": "ENG"}], "last_modified": "2023-05-04 17:55:52.136675+00:00", "order_by": "2022-10-05 15:54:03.677102+00:00", "path": "Clint Smith/How the Word Is Passed_ A Reckoning (113)", "pubdate": "2021-06-01", "publisher_ids": "68", "publishers": [{"avg_rating": 8.5, "count": 4, "id": 68, "name": "Little, Brown and Company", "sort": "Little, Brown and Company"}], "rating": 5, "series": [], "series_ids": null, "size": 568333, "tag_ids": "57,60,194", "tags": [{"avg_rating": 8.333333333333334, "count": 40, "id": 194, "name": "Time", "sort": 40}, {"avg_rating": 8.363636363636363, "count": 24, "id": 60, "name": "History", "sort": 24}, {"avg_rating": 8.347826086956522, "count": 23, "id": 57, "name": "Politics", "sort": 23}], "timestamp": "2022-10-05 15:54:03.677102+00:00", "title": "How the Word Is Passed: A Reckoning With the History of Slavery Across America"}, {"author_ids": "114", "authors": [{"avg_rating": 10.0, "count": 1, "id": 114, "name": "Andrea Elliott", "sort": "Elliott, Andrea"}], "comments": "\u003cdiv\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn Invisible Child, Pulitzer Prize winner Andrea Elliott follows eight dramatic years in the life of Dasani, a girl whose imagination is as soaring as the skyscrapers near her Brooklyn shelter.

Joffrey, of House Lannister, sits on the Iron Throne, the uneasy ruler of the land of the Seven Kingdoms. His most bitter rival, Lord Stannis, stands defeated and disgraced, the victim of the jealous sorceress who holds him in her evil thrall. But young Robb, of House Stark, still rules the North from the fortress of Riverrun. Robb plots against his despised Lannister enemies, even as they hold his sister hostage at King\u0027s Landing, the seat of the Iron Throne. Meanwhile, making her way across a blood-drenched continent is the exiled queen, Daenerys, mistress of the only three dragons still left in the world. Filled with the stench of death and decay from the destructive dynastic war, Daenerys is gathering allies and strength for an assault on King\u0027s Landing, hoping to win back the crown she believes is rightfully hers. But as opposing forces maneuver for the final titanic showdown, an army of barbaric wildlings bent on overwhelming the Seven Kingdoms arrives from the outermost line of civilization. In their vanguard is a horde of mythical Others\u2014a supernatural army of the living dead whose animated corpses are unstoppable. And as the future of the land hangs in the balance, no one will rest in the quest for victory until the Seven Kingdoms have exploded in a veritable storm of swords....

With A Game of Thrones, George R. R. Martin has launched a genuine masterpiece, bringing together the best the genre has to offer. Mystery, intrigue, romance, and adventure fill the pages of this magnificent saga, the first volume in an epic series sure to delight fantasy fans everywhere.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLong ago, in a time forgotten, a preternatural event threw the seasons out of balance. In a land where summers can last decades and winters a lifetime, trouble is brewing. The cold is returning, and in the frozen wastes to the north of Winterfell, sinister forces are massing beyond the kingdom\u0027s protective Wall. To the south, the king\u0027s powers are failing--his most trusted adviser dead under mysterious circumstances and his enemies emerging from the shadows of the throne. At the center of the conflict lie the Starks of Winterfell, a family as harsh and unyielding as the frozen land they were born to. Now Lord Eddard Stark is reluctantly summoned to serve as the king\u0027s new Hand, an appointment that threatens to sunder not only his family but the kingdom itself. Sweeping from a harsh land of cold to a summertime kingdom of epicurean plenty, A Game of Thrones tells a tale of lords and ladies, soldiers and sorcerers, assassins and bastards, who come together in a time of grim omens.

He explains that work that demands your full focus is intrinsically valuable and rewarding. You need to be able to handle \"deep work\" to succeed in an information economy. Yet people face increasing distractions or social pressure that drive them toward shallow work. Newport develops his ideas with a blend of formal research, stories and personal accounts about the challenges and rewards of deep work. He provides tips for arranging your life to support deep work, which he sees as valuable, productive and rare. He makes his case persuasively and even poetically. getAbstract recommends his guidance to knowledge workers and anyone else who is seeking flow, creativity or focus.

An acronym for \"Phenethylamines I Have Known and Loved\", the book spans autobiography, organic chemistry, politics, ethnobotany, and psychopharmacology, and the cultural impact is likely to be profound for decades to come, as it has already. PiHKAL is divided into two parts, the first of which is a fictionalized autobiographical \u0027novel\u0027 - the main fiction is that it is fiction. This first half of the book is The Love Story, about two people named Shura and Alice who fall in love, though one of them is already in love with someone else. This love triangle is a painful ordeal they must go through, and that process unfolds before the reader with grace and great insight into human nature. Shura is a brilliant chemist who has dedicated his career to making psychoactive drugs, in the story they go through many experiences with the psychedelic compounds that Shura has discovered and has made in his lab, all of which have been bioassayed himself. The reader will find themselves going on this journey with them, experiencing what they experienced, both in their hearts and in the psychedelic journeys they have. The second half of PiHKAL is called The Chemical Story, and it contains detailed instructions for, and effects of, the synthesis of 179 psychedelic phenethylamines which were mostly discovered by Shulgin himself. For each substance there is information on its synthesis, suggested effective dosage, duration, and detailed commentary on the subjective effects that were experienced.

Scott Fitzgerald that follows a cast of characters living in the fictional town of West Egg on prosperous Long Island in the summer of 1922. The story primarily concerns the young and mysterious millionaire Jay Gatsby and his quixotic passion and obsession for the beautiful former debutante Daisy Buchanan. Considered to be Fitzgerald\u0027s magnum opus, The Great Gatsby explores themes of decadence, idealism, resistance to change, social upheaval, and excess, creating a portrait of the Jazz Age or the Roaring Twenties that has been described as a cautionary tale regarding the American Dream. Fitzgerald-inspired by the parties he had attended while visiting Long Island\u0027s north shore-began planning the novel in 1923, desiring to produce, in his words, \"something new-something extraordinary and beautiful and simple and intricately patterned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\" Progress was slow, with Fitzgerald completing his first draft following a move to the French Riviera in 1924. His editor, Maxwell Perkins, felt the book was vague and persuaded the author to revise over the next winter. Fitzgerald was repeatedly ambivalent about the book\u0027s title and he considered a variety of alternatives, including titles that referenced the Roman character Trimalchio; the title he was last documented to have desired was Under the Red, White, and Blue. In its first year, the book sold only 20,000 copies. Fitzgerald died in 1940, believing himself to be a failure and his work forgotten. However, the novel experienced a revival during World War II, and became a part of American high school curricula and numerous stage and film adaptations in the following decades. Today, The Great Gatsby is widely considered to be a literary classic and a contender for the title \"Great American Novel\". In 1998, the Modern Library editorial board voted it the 20th century\u0027s best American novel and second best English-language novel of the same time period.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e", "custom_clean": 1, "custom_lists": [{"id": 6, "sort": "Must Read.10 Greatest Books of All Time", "value": "Must Read.10 Greatest Books of All Time"}, {"id": 7, "sort": "Gutenberg Collection", "value": "Gutenberg Collection"}], "custom_lists_ids": "6,7", "custom_read_date": null, "custom_reading_list": 0, "custom_types": "eBook", "flags": 1, "has_cover": 1, "id": 211, "identifier_ids": "771,768,769,770", "identifiers": [{"book": 211, "id": 770, "name": "ISBN", "path": "https://www.worldcat.org/isbn/9789176371213", "sort": "isbn", "type": "isbn", "val": "9789176371213"}, {"book": 211, "id": 769, "name": "Gutenberg", "path": "http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/64317", "sort": "gutenberg", "type": "gutenberg", "val": "64317"}, {"book": 211, "id": 768, "name": "Google Books", "path": "https://books.google.com/books?id=u-OCjwEACAAJ", "sort": "google", "type": "google", "val": "u-OCjwEACAAJ"}, {"book": 211, "id": 771, "name": "Goodreads", "path": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28787401", "sort": "goodreads", "type": "goodreads", "val": "28787401"}], "isbn": "9789176371213", "language_ids": "1", "languages": [{"avg_rating": 8.429245283018869, "count": 341, "id": 1, "name": "ENG", "sort": "ENG"}], "last_modified": "2023-05-04 17:55:52.136675+00:00", "order_by": "2022-10-10 14:39:37.098030+00:00", "path": "F.

Living Down and Out in Paris and London , repudiating respectable imperialist society, and reinventing himself as George Orwell. His 1933 debut book (ostensibly a novel, but overwhelmingly autobiographical) was rejected by that elitist publisher T. S. Eliot, perhaps because its close-up portrait of lowlife was too pungent for comfort.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn Paris, Orwell lived in verminous rooms and washed dishes at the overpriced \"Hotel X,\" in a remarkably filthy, 110-degree kitchen. He met \"eccentric people \u2013 people who have fallen into solitary, half-mad grooves of life and given up trying to be normal or decent.\" Though Orwell\u0027s tone is that of an outraged reformer, it\u0027s surprising how entertaining many of his adventures are: gnawing poverty only enlivens the imagination, and the wild characters he met often swindled each other and themselves. The wackiest tale involves a miser who ate cats, wore newspapers for underwear, invested 6,000 francs in cocaine, and hid it in a face-powder tin when the cops raided. They had to free him, because the apparently controlled substance turned out to be face powder instead of cocaine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn London, Orwell studied begging with a crippled expert named Bozo, a great storyteller and philosopher. Orwell devotes a chapter to the fine points of London guttersnipe slang. Years later, he would put his lexical bent to work by inventing Newspeak, and draw on his down-and-out experience to evoke the plight of the Proles in 1984. Though marred by hints of unexamined anti-Semitism, Orwell\u0027s debut remains, as The Nation put it, \"the most lucid portrait of poverty in the English language.\" --Tim Appelo\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e", "custom_clean": 1, "custom_lists": [], "custom_lists_ids": null, "custom_read_date": null, "custom_reading_list": 0, "custom_types": "eBook", "flags": 1, "has_cover": 1, "id": 159, "identifier_ids": "483,484,481,482", "identifiers": [{"book": 159, "id": 482, "name": "ISBN", "path": "https://www.worldcat.org/isbn/9780156262248", "sort": "isbn", "type": "isbn", "val": "9780156262248"}, {"book": 159, "id": 481, "name": "Google Books", "path": "https://books.google.com/books?id=m5vIVN7LjtgC", "sort": "google", "type": "google", "val": "m5vIVN7LjtgC"}, {"book": 159, "id": 484, "name": "Goodreads", "path": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34304872", "sort": "goodreads", "type": "goodreads", "val": "34304872"}, {"book": 159, "id": 483, "name": "Amazon", "path": "https://amazon.com/dp/015626224X", "sort": "amazon", "type": "amazon", "val": "015626224X"}], "isbn": "9780156262248", "language_ids": "1", "languages": [{"avg_rating": 8.429245283018869, "count": 341, "id": 1, "name": "ENG", "sort": "ENG"}], "last_modified": "2023-05-04 17:55:52.136675+00:00", "order_by": "2022-10-06 09:35:53.313990+00:00", "path": "George Orwell/Down and Out in Paris and London (159)", "pubdate": "1933-01-01", "publisher_ids": "90", "publishers": [{"avg_rating": 8.8, "count": 20, "id": 90, "name": "Penguin Random House", "sort": "Penguin Random House"}], "rating": 4, "series": [], "series_ids": null, "size": 690052, "tag_ids": "57,60,90,92,153", "tags": [{"avg_rating": 8.222222222222221, "count": 31, "id": 92, "name": "Biography", "sort": 31}, {"avg_rating": 8.578947368421053, "count": 28, "id": 153, "name": "Classics", "sort": 28}, {"avg_rating": 8.363636363636363, "count": 24, "id": 60, "name": "History", "sort": 24}, {"avg_rating": 8.347826086956522, "count": 23, "id": 57, "name": "Politics", "sort": 23}, {"avg_rating": 7.5, "count": 4, "id": 90, "name": "Travel", "sort": 4}], "timestamp": "2022-10-06 09:35:53.313990+00:00", "title": "Down and Out in Paris and London"}, {"author_ids": "166", "authors": [{"avg_rating": 8.0, "count": 1, "id": 166, "name": "John Kennedy Toole", "sort": "Toole, John Kennedy"}], "comments": "\u003cdiv\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReleased by Louisiana State University Press in 1980, A Confederacy of Dunces is nothing short of a publishing phenomenon.

No one in her family, in either the United States or Colombia, spoke of infectious diseases, and even into her thirties, she only knew that her aunt had died of a rare illness called Chagas. But as Hern\u00e1ndez dug deeper, she discovered that Chagas\u2014or the kissing bug disease\u2014is more prevalent in the United States than the Zika virus. Today, more than three hundred thousand Americans have Chagas.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy do some infectious diseases make headlines and others fall by the wayside?

She learns that outside of Latin America, the United States is the only country with the native insects\u2014the \"kissing bugs\"\u2014that carry the Chagas parasite. She spends a night in southwest Texas hunting the dreaded bug with university researchers. She also gets to know patients, like a mother whose premature baby was born infected with the parasite, his heart already damaged.

Sullivan, Jr., Washington Post From one of our top historians, a groundbreaking story of policing and \u201criots\u201d that shatters our understanding of the post\u2013civil rights era. What began in spring 2020 as local protests in response to the killing of George Floyd by Minneapolis police quickly exploded into a massive nationwide movement. Millions of mostly young people defiantly flooded into the nation\u2019s streets, demanding an end to police brutality and to the broader, systemic repression of Black people and other people of color. To many observers, the protests appeared to be without precedent in their scale and persistence. Yet, as the acclaimed historian Elizabeth Hinton demonstrates in America on Fire, the events of 2020 had clear precursors\u2014and any attempt to understand our current crisis requires a reckoning with the recent past. Even in the aftermath of Donald Trump, many Americans consider the decades since the civil rights movement in the mid-1960s as a story of progress toward greater inclusiveness and equality. Hinton\u2019s sweeping narrative uncovers an altogether different history, taking us on a troubling journey from Detroit in 1967 and Miami in 1980 to Los Angeles in 1992 and beyond to chart the persistence of structural racism and one of its primary consequences, the so-called urban riot. Hinton offers a critical corrective: the word riot was nothing less than a racist trope applied to events that can only be properly understood as rebellions\u2014explosions of collective resistance to an unequal and violent order. As she suggests, if rebellion and the conditions that precipitated it never disappeared, the optimistic story of a post\u2013Jim Crow United States no longer holds. Black rebellion, America on Fire powerfully illustrates, was born in response to poverty and exclusion, but most immediately in reaction to police violence. In 1968, President Lyndon Johnson launched the \u201cWar on Crime,\u201d sending militarized police forces into impoverished Black neighborhoods. Facing increasing surveillance and brutality, residents threw rocks and Molotov cocktails at officers, plundered local businesses, and vandalized exploitative institutions. Hinton draws on exclusive sources to uncover a previously hidden geography of violence in smaller American cities, from York, Pennsylvania, to Cairo, Illinois, to Stockton, California. The central lesson from these eruptions\u2014that police violence invariably leads to community violence\u2014continues to escape policymakers, who respond by further criminalizing entire groups instead of addressing underlying socioeconomic causes. The results are the hugely expanded policing and prison regimes that shape the lives of so many Americans today. Presenting a new framework for understanding our nation\u2019s enduring strife, America on Fire is also a warning: rebellions will surely continue unless police are no longer called on to manage the consequences of dismal conditions beyond their control, and until an oppressive system is finally remade on the principles of justice and equality.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e", "custom_clean": 1, "custom_lists": [{"id": 5, "sort": "Must Read.2021 Time", "value": "Must Read.2021 Time"}], "custom_lists_ids": "5", "custom_read_date": null, "custom_reading_list": 0, "custom_types": "eBook", "flags": 1, "has_cover": 1, "id": 144, "identifier_ids": "351,352,353", "identifiers": [{"book": 144, "id": 353, "name": "ISBN", "path": "https://www.worldcat.org/isbn/9781631498916", "sort": "isbn", "type": "isbn", "val": "9781631498916"}, {"book": 144, "id": 352, "name": "Google Books", "path": "https://books.google.com/books?id=PAwDEAAAQBAJ", "sort": "google", "type": "google", "val": "PAwDEAAAQBAJ"}, {"book": 144, "id": 351, "name": "Goodreads", "path": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/55298326", "sort": "goodreads", "type": "goodreads", "val": "55298326"}], "isbn": "9781631498916", "language_ids": "1", "languages": [{"avg_rating": 8.429245283018869, "count": 341, "id": 1, "name": "ENG", "sort": "ENG"}], "last_modified": "2023-05-04 17:55:52.136675+00:00", "order_by": "2022-10-05 15:54:15.142378+00:00", "path": "Elizabeth Hinton/America on Fire_ The Untold History (144)", "pubdate": "2021-05-18", "publisher_ids": "84", "publishers": [{"avg_rating": 8.0, "count": 4, "id": 84, "name": "Liveright Publishing", "sort": "Liveright Publishing"}], "rating": 4, "series": [], "series_ids": null, "size": 12900649, "tag_ids": "57,60,194", "tags": [{"avg_rating": 8.333333333333334, "count": 40, "id": 194, "name": "Time", "sort": 40}, {"avg_rating": 8.363636363636363, "count": 24, "id": 60, "name": "History", "sort": 24}, {"avg_rating": 8.347826086956522, "count": 23, "id": 57, "name": "Politics", "sort": 23}], "timestamp": "2022-10-05 15:54:15.142378+00:00", "title": "America on Fire: The Untold History of Police Violence and Black Rebellion Since the 1960s"}, {"author_ids": "145", "authors": [{"avg_rating": 8.0, "count": 1, "id": 145, "name": "Elizabeth Kolbert", "sort": "Kolbert, Elizabeth"}], "comments": "\u003cdiv\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNATIONAL BESTSELLER * The Pulitzer Prize-winning author of The Sixth Extinction returns to humanity\u0027s transformative impact on the environment, now asking: After doing so much damage, can we change nature, this time to save it?

So pervasive are human impacts on the planet that it\u0027s said we live in a new geological epoch: the Anthropocene. In Under a White Sky, Elizabeth Kolbert takes a hard look at the new world we are creating. Along the way, she meets biologists who are trying to preserve the world\u0027s rarest fish, which lives in a single tiny pool in the middle of the Mojave; engineers who are turning carbon emissions to stone in Iceland; Australian researchers who are trying to develop a \"super coral\" that can survive on a hotter globe; and physicists who are contemplating shooting tiny diamonds into the stratosphere to cool the earth. One way to look at human civilization, says Kolbert, is as a ten-thousand-year exercise in defying nature. In The Sixth Extinction, she explored the ways in which our capacity for destruction has reshaped the natural world. Now she examines how the very sorts of interventions that have imperiled our planet are increasingly seen as the only hope for its salvation. By turns inspiring, terrifying, and darkly comic, Under a White Sky is an utterly original examination of the challenges we face.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e", "custom_clean": 1, "custom_lists": [{"id": 5, "sort": "Must Read.2021 Time", "value": "Must Read.2021 Time"}], "custom_lists_ids": "5", "custom_read_date": null, "custom_reading_list": 0, "custom_types": "eBook", "flags": 1, "has_cover": 1, "id": 143, "identifier_ids": "462,461,460,459", "identifiers": [{"book": 143, "id": 459, "name": "ISBN", "path": "https://www.worldcat.org/isbn/9780593136287", "sort": "isbn", "type": "isbn", "val": "9780593136287"}, {"book": 143, "id": 460, "name": "Google Books", "path": "https://books.google.com/books?id=qwpjEAAAQBAJ", "sort": "google", "type": "google", "val": "qwpjEAAAQBAJ"}, {"book": 143, "id": 461, "name": "Goodreads", "path": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/60757903", "sort": "goodreads", "type": "goodreads", "val": "60757903"}, {"book": 143, "id": 462, "name": "Amazon", "path": "https://amazon.com/dp/B08DMWR6BP", "sort": "amazon", "type": "amazon", "val": "B08DMWR6BP"}], "isbn": "9780593136287", "language_ids": "1", "languages": [{"avg_rating": 8.429245283018869, "count": 341, "id": 1, "name": "ENG", "sort": "ENG"}], "last_modified": "2023-05-04 17:55:52.136675+00:00", "order_by": "2022-10-05 15:54:14.761371+00:00", "path": "Elizabeth Kolbert/Under a White Sky_ The Nature of th (143)", "pubdate": "2021-02-09", "publisher_ids": "100", "publishers": [{"avg_rating": 8.0, "count": 6, "id": 100, "name": "Crown Publishing Group", "sort": "Crown Publishing Group"}], "rating": 4, "series": [], "series_ids": null, "size": 4317039, "tag_ids": "57,58,60,125,194,253", "tags": [{"avg_rating": 8.333333333333334, "count": 40, "id": 194, "name": "Time", "sort": 40}, {"avg_rating": 8.363636363636363, "count": 24, "id": 60, "name": "History", "sort": 24}, {"avg_rating": 8.347826086956522, "count": 23, "id": 57, "name": "Politics", "sort": 23}, {"avg_rating": 8.222222222222221, "count": 11, "id": 58, "name": "Science", "sort": 11}, {"avg_rating": 8.0, "count": 2, "id": 253, "name": "Non-Fiction", "sort": 2}, {"avg_rating": 8.0, "count": 1, "id": 125, "name": "Climate Crisis", "sort": 1}], "timestamp": "2022-10-05 15:54:14.761371+00:00", "title": "Under a White Sky: The Nature of the Future"}, {"author_ids": "144", "authors": [{"avg_rating": 8.0, "count": 1, "id": 144, "name": "Gabriel Krauze", "sort": "Krauze, Gabriel"}], "comments": "\u003cdiv\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLonglisted for the Booker Prize 2020 A Spectator Book of the Year \u0027A literary rendering of the Top Boy generation...

Nobody, including the lawmakers who passed the bill, expected it to transform the country\u2019s demographics. But over the next four decades, millions arrived, including Jay Caspian Kang\u2019s parents, grandparents, aunts, and uncles. They came with almost no understanding of their new home, much less the history of \u201cAsian America\u201d that was supposed to define them.\u00a0The Loneliest Americans is the unforgettable story of Kang and his family as they move from a housing project in Cambridge to an idyllic college town in the South and eventually to the West Coast.

One morning, when Kat was nine, her mother, a vivacious and mischievous woman, casually made a morbid joke: When she eventually dies, she said laughing, she\u0027d like to be stuffed and displayed in Kat\u0027s future apartment in order to always watch over her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFour years later when her mother dies unexpectedly from cancer, Kat, her two older sisters, and their father are plunged into a debilitating, lonely grief.

Pop Song is a book about love and about falling in love\u2014with a place, or a painting, or a person\u2014and the joy and terror inherent in the experience of that love. Plumbing the well of culture for clues and patterns about love and loss\u2014from Agnes Martin\u0027s abstract paintings to James Turrell\u0027s transcendent light works, and Anne Carson\u0027s Eros the Bittersweet to Frank Ocean\u0027s Blonde\u2014Pham writes of her youthful attempts to find meaning in travel, sex, drugs, and art, before sensing that she might need to turn her gaze upon herself. Pop Song is also a book about distances, near and far. As she travels from Taos, New Mexico, to Shanghai, China and beyond, Pham meditates on the miles we are willing to cover to get away from ourselves, or those who hurt us, and the impossible gaps that can exist between two people sharing a bed. Pop Song is a book about all the routes by which we might escape our own needs before finally finding a way home. There is heartache in these pages, but Pham\u0027s electric ways of seeing create a perfectly fractured portrait of modern intimacy that is triumphant in both its vulnerability and restlessness. \"Each of the essays in this debut collection reads like a mini-memoir ... in which the author reflects on her experiences of young love, trauma, and transcendence through discussions of art and music ... with an intimacy that is at once tender and expansive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\" \u2014New York magazine\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e", "custom_clean": 1, "custom_lists": [{"id": 5, "sort": "Must Read.2021 Time", "value": "Must Read.2021 Time"}], "custom_lists_ids": "5", "custom_read_date": null, "custom_reading_list": 0, "custom_types": "eBook", "flags": 1, "has_cover": 1, "id": 133, "identifier_ids": "320,318,319", "identifiers": [{"book": 133, "id": 319, "name": "ISBN", "path": "https://www.worldcat.org/isbn/9781646220274", "sort": "isbn", "type": "isbn", "val": "9781646220274"}, {"book": 133, "id": 318, "name": "Google Books", "path": "https://books.google.com/books?id=V6UQEAAAQBAJ", "sort": "google", "type": "google", "val": "V6UQEAAAQBAJ"}, {"book": 133, "id": 320, "name": "Goodreads", "path": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/60057391", "sort": "goodreads", "type": "goodreads", "val": "60057391"}], "isbn": "9781646220274", "language_ids": "1", "languages": [{"avg_rating": 8.429245283018869, "count": 341, "id": 1, "name": "ENG", "sort": "ENG"}], "last_modified": "2023-05-04 17:55:52.136675+00:00", "order_by": "2022-10-05 15:54:11.131714+00:00", "path": "Larissa Pham/Pop Song_ Adventures in Art \u0026 Intim (133)", "pubdate": "2021-05-04", "publisher_ids": "77", "publishers": [{"avg_rating": 8.0, "count": 1, "id": 77, "name": "Catapult", "sort": "Catapult"}], "rating": 4, "series": [], "series_ids": null, "size": 1035488, "tag_ids": "44,49,92,132,133,194", "tags": [{"avg_rating": 8.89655172413793, "count": 51, "id": 49, "name": "Contemporary", "sort": 51}, {"avg_rating": 8.333333333333334, "count": 40, "id": 194, "name": "Time", "sort": 40}, {"avg_rating": 8.222222222222221, "count": 31, "id": 92, "name": "Biography", "sort": 31}, {"avg_rating": 8.0, "count": 6, "id": 44, "name": "Art", "sort": 6}, {"avg_rating": 7.6, "count": 6, "id": 132, "name": "Music", "sort": 6}, {"avg_rating": 8.333333333333334, "count": 6, "id": 133, "name": "Feminism", "sort": 6}], "timestamp": "2022-10-05 15:54:11.131714+00:00", "title": "Pop Song: Adventures in Art \u0026 Intimacy"}, {"author_ids": "134", "authors": [{"avg_rating": 8.0, "count": 1, "id": 134, "name": "Louis Menand", "sort": "Menand, Louis"}], "comments": "\u003cdiv\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"An engrossing and impossibly wide-ranging project ...

It was also about ideas, in the broadest sense\u2014economic and political, artistic and personal. In The Free World, the acclaimed Pulitzer Prize\u2013winning scholar and critic Louis Menand tells the story of American culture in the pivotal years from the end of World War II to Vietnam and shows how changing economic, technological, and social forces put their mark on creations of the mind. How did elitism and an anti-totalitarian skepticism of passion and ideology give way to a new sensibility defined by freewheeling experimentation and loving the Beatles? How was the ideal of \u201cfreedom\u201d applied to causes that ranged from anti-communism and civil rights to radical acts of self-creation via art and even crime? With the wit and insight familiar to readers of The Metaphysical Club and his New Yorker essays, Menand takes us inside Hannah Arendt\u2019s Manhattan, the Paris of Jean-Paul Sartre and Simone de Beauvoir, Merce Cunningham and John Cage\u2019s residencies at North Carolina\u2019s Black Mountain College, and the Memphis studio where Sam Phillips and Elvis Presley created a new music for the American teenager. He examines the post war vogue for French existentialism, structuralism and post-structuralism, the rise of abstract expressionism and pop art, Allen Ginsberg\u2019s friendship with Lionel Trilling, James Baldwin\u2019s transformation into a Civil Right spokesman, Susan Sontag\u2019s challenges to the New York Intellectuals, the defeat of obscenity laws, and the rise of the New Hollywood. Stressing the rich flow of ideas across the Atlantic, he also shows how Europeans played a vital role in promoting and influencing American art and entertainment.

Next he directed four consecutive hit plays, won back-to-back Tonys, ushered in a new era of Hollywood moviemaking with Who\u0027s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?, and followed it with The Graduate, which won him an Oscar and became the third-highest-grossing movie ever. At thirty-five, he lived in a three-story Central Park West penthouse, drove a Rolls-Royce, collected Arabian horses, and counted Jacqueline Kennedy, Elizabeth Taylor, Leonard Bernstein, and Richard Avedon as friends.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhere he arrived is even more astonishing given where he had begun: born Igor Peschkowsky to a Jewish couple in Berlin in 1931, he was sent along with his younger brother to America on a ship in 1939.

He was bullied and ostracized--an allergic reaction had rendered him permanently hairless--and his father died when he was just twelve, leaving his mother alone and overwhelmed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe gulf between these two sets of facts explains a great deal about Nichols\u0027s transformation from lonely outsider to the center of more than one cultural universe--the acute powers of observation that first made him famous; the nourishment he drew from his creative partnerships, most enduringly with May; his unquenchable drive; his hunger for security and status; and the depressions and self-medications that brought him to terrible lows. It would take decades for him to come to grips with his demons. In an incomparable portrait that follows Nichols from Berlin to New York to Chicago to Hollywood, Mark Harris explores, with brilliantly vivid detail and insight, the life, work, struggle, and passion of an artist and man in constant motion. Among the 250 people Harris interviewed: Elaine May, Meryl Streep, Stephen Sondheim, Robert Redford, Glenn Close, Tom Hanks, Candice Bergen, Emma Thompson, Annette Bening, Natalie Portman, Julia Roberts, Lorne Michaels, and Gloria Steinem.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMark Harris gives an intimate and evenhanded accounting of success and failure alike; the portrait is not always flattering, but its ultimate impact is to present the full story of one of the most richly interesting, complicated, and consequential figures the worlds of theater and motion pictures have ever seen.

As she shows, the murder of the Indigenous man set the entire mid-Atlantic on edge, with many believing war was imminent. Isolated killings often flared into colonial wars in North America, and colonists now anticipated a vengeful Indigenous uprising. Frantic efforts to resolve the case ignited a dramatic, far-reaching debate between Native American forms of justice\u2014centered on community, forgiveness, and reparations\u2014and an ideology of harsh reprisal, unique to the colonies and based on British law, which called for the killers\u2019 swift execution.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn charting the far-reaching ramifications of the murder, Covered with Night \u2014a phrase from Iroquois mourning practices\u2014overturns persistent assumptions about \u201ccivilized\u201d Europeans and \u201csavage\u201d Native Americans.

Very soon he\u0027s lured from his duties into a hunt for a fantastic treasure discovered by archaeologists and carefully hushed up. The long-vanished Martians who once colonised the galaxy have left a buried hyperspace gateway leading to a working starship in distant orbit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKovacs uses frightening violence to get the attention of corporate sponsors even more ruthless than himself. His hastily assembled exploration team must work in a lethal fallout zone, racing to open the gate before they\u0027re stopped by radiation sickness, treacherous sabotage, or the threat of fast-evolving nanoweaponry. And there are repeated hints that if they ever make it through that gateway, worse things are waiting on the far side...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0027s all desperately tense and crafted with appalling inventiveness. Life is cheap and death is no release, because the \"cortical stack\" implanted in everyone\u0027s spine constantly records the total personality, ready for \"re-sleeving\" in a new clone body or storage in virtual reality. So Kovacs goes recruiting at the macabre Soul Market, where thanks to the war there are literal skiploads of hacked-out sections of human spine containing stacks--for sale by the kilogram.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOther ingredients include sex, voodoo, torture, multiple betrayal, cool military technology, incomprehensible alien constructions, age-old cycles of catastrophe, and--above all--extreme violence. The screw is turned further and further, beyond what seems possible. Readers may find themselves forgetting to breathe. This is a rattling good yarn, for the strong of stomach. --David Langford\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e", "custom_clean": 1, "custom_lists": [], "custom_lists_ids": null, "custom_read_date": "2022-06-08", "custom_reading_list": 0, "custom_types": "eBook", "flags": 1, "has_cover": 1, "id": 75, "identifier_ids": "169,168,166,167", "identifiers": [{"book": 75, "id": 167, "name": "ISBN", "path": "https://www.worldcat.org/isbn/9780575075504", "sort": "isbn", "type": "isbn", "val": "9780575075504"}, {"book": 75, "id": 166, "name": "Google Books", "path": "https://books.google.com/books?id=H_FyPwAACAAJ", "sort": "google", "type": "google", "val": "H_FyPwAACAAJ"}, {"book": 75, "id": 168, "name": "Goodreads", "path": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1117988", "sort": "goodreads", "type": "goodreads", "val": "1117988"}, {"book": 75, "id": 169, "name": "Amazon", "path": "https://amazon.com/dp/0345457714", "sort": "amazon", "type": "amazon", "val": "0345457714"}], "isbn": "9780575075504", "language_ids": "1", "languages": [{"avg_rating": 8.429245283018869, "count": 341, "id": 1, "name": "ENG", "sort": "ENG"}], "last_modified": "2022-10-06 17:19:38.709950+00:00", "order_by": "2022-10-04 19:29:45.875671+00:00", "path": "Richard K.

Kovacs can deal with the madness of AI. He can do his part in a battle against biomachines gone wild, search for a three-centuries-old missing weapons system, and live with a blood feud with the yakuza, and even with the betrayal of people he once trusted. But when his relationship with \u201cthe\u201d Falconer brings him an enemy specially designed to destroy him, he knows it\u2019s time to be afraid.

It Doesn\u0027t Have to Be Crazy at Work is a direct successor to Rework, the instant bestseller that showed readers a new path to working effectively. Now Fried and Heinemeier Hansson have returned with a new strategy for the ideal company culture - what they call the calm company . It is a direct attack on the chaos, anxiety and stress that plagues millions of workplaces and billions of people working their day jobs. Working to breaking point with long hours, excessive workload, and a lack of sleep have become a badge of honour for many people these days, when it should be a mark of stupidity. This isn\u0027t just a problem for large organisations; individuals, contractors and solopreneurs are burning themselves out in the very same way. As the authors reveal, the answer isn\u0027t more hours. Rather, it\u0027s less waste and fewer things that induce distraction, always-on anxiety and stress. It is time to stop celebrating crazy and start celebrating calm. Fried and Hansson have the proof to back up their argument. Calm has been the cornerstone of their company\u0027s culture since Basecamp began twenty years ago.

When we bring both respect and interpersonal savvy to our work relationships, we do more than make people feel good. We enhance personal and organizational performance. And as the workplace grows more complex and competitive, managing our work relationships becomes even more essential and difficult. Now more than ever we need to work people smart. Working PeopleSmart describes the six core strategies used by people-smart individuals and shows how to apply them in the toughest workplace situations. Individuals who are people smart know how to open others up rather than make them defensive or resistant. They have a knack for diffusing tension rather than creating it. They set a good example through their own behavior on the job and can inspire and influence others with less developed skills. Working PeopleSmart can serve as your virtual coach to guide you through difficult work relationships skillfully. How do you deal with a critical colleague? Make your boss listen to you? React to an offensive joke? Get the resources you need? The authors look at over 50 real-life situations and offer people-smart prescriptions for handling them effectively. They provide coaching tips for each scenario and describe exactly what a people-smart response sounds like. As two psychologists with both organizational and clinical expertise, coauthors Mel Silberman and Freda Hansburg are highly qualified to deliver the message that we can emerge from even the toughest interpersonal moments on the job with dignity and grace. Where other books rely on typologies that categorize people according to their interpersonal styles and then offer advice on how to deal with each type, the strategies described in Working PeopleSmart are straightforward and universal. They can be used immediately to deal with any type of person or any situation, no matter how difficult or sensitive.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e", "custom_clean": 1, "custom_lists": [], "custom_lists_ids": null, "custom_read_date": null, "custom_reading_list": 0, "custom_types": "eBook", "flags": 1, "has_cover": 1, "id": 34, "identifier_ids": "122,121,123", "identifiers": [{"book": 34, "id": 123, "name": "ISBN", "path": "https://www.worldcat.org/isbn/9781576752081", "sort": "isbn", "type": "isbn", "val": "9781576752081"}, {"book": 34, "id": 121, "name": "Google Books", "path": "https://books.google.com/books?id=YZgNngEACAAJ", "sort": "google", "type": "google", "val": "YZgNngEACAAJ"}, {"book": 34, "id": 122, "name": "Goodreads", "path": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1946690", "sort": "goodreads", "type": "goodreads", "val": "1946690"}], "isbn": "9781576752081", "language_ids": "1", "languages": [{"avg_rating": 8.429245283018869, "count": 341, "id": 1, "name": "ENG", "sort": "ENG"}], "last_modified": "2022-10-06 17:19:38.709950+00:00", "order_by": "2022-10-04 13:46:41.441000+00:00", "path": "Melvin L.

Postmaster General Moist von Lipwig, former arch-swindler and confidence man, has exceeded all expectations\u2014including his own.

He\u0027s referring, rather, to the Royal Mint of Ankh-Morpork, a venerable institution that haas run for centuries on the hereditary employment of the Men of the Sheds and their loyal outworkers, who do make money in their spare time.

In the newest appealing installment of the Discworld series, Pratchett (The Truth) takes on religion, time and... kung-fu movies? The cast includes Death; Miss Susan, Death\u0027s granddaughter; Jeremy Clockson, a clockmaker; Lobsang, a novice monk; and Lu-Tze, a sweeper at the temple of the History Monks. When a mysterious lady asks Jeremy to make a clock that is perfectly timed (even to the last tick), trouble begins it seems that such a clock would have the power to stop time completely. There would be no yesterday, no tomorrow, no next minute; in fact, everything and everyone would stop in its tracks. It\u0027s up to Miss Susan, Lobsang and Lu-Tze to figure out who in the end has decided to build the dangerous clock and how to stop him before the world crashes to a halt. Along the way we learn Rule One: \"Do not act incautiously when confronting a little bald wrinkly smiling man,\" which is a very good lesson to learn. We also find out that Lobsang has more in store for his future than to be an apprentice monk. The story includes a quick nod to James Bond flicks with Qu, the monk who supplies gadgets to Lu-Tze and Lobsang, and at the end of Time the four (no, make that five) horsemen of the Apocalypse get to ride out for a jaunt. You don\u0027t need to catch all the in-jokes to enjoy the fun.

Not the way they look, and especially not the way they talk: word-filled balloons come out of their mouths and then disintegrate, leaving dust all over his rug.Eddie will work for a Toon if his cash supply is low enough. So he reluctantly agrees when Roger Rabbit, a Toon who plays straight man (or should that be straight rabbit) in the Baby Herman cartoon series, asks him to find out who\u2019s been trying \u2013 unsuccessfully \u2013 to buy his contract from the DeGreasy Brothers syndicate.Then Rocco DeGreasy is murdered \u2013 and Roger is the prime suspect!

Why had Jessica \u2013 a pretty steamy number for a Toon \u2013 ever married a dopey bunny in the first place?

In 1942, with Nazis occupying Holland, a thirteen-year-old Jewish girl and her family fled their home in Amsterdam and went into hiding. For the next two years, until their whereabouts were betrayed to the Gestapo, they and another family lived cloistered in the \"Secret Annex\" of an old office building. Cut off from the outside world, they faced hunger, boredom, the constant cruelties of living in confined quarters, and the ever-present threat of discovery and death. In her diary Anne Frank recorded vivid impressions of her experiences during this period. By turns thoughtful, moving, and amusing, her account offers a fascinating commentary on human courage and frailty and a compelling self-portrait of a sensitive and spirited young woman whose promise was tragically cut short.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e", "custom_clean": 1, "custom_lists": [{"id": 14, "sort": "Must Read.25 Must Read", "value": "Must Read.25 Must Read"}], "custom_lists_ids": "14", "custom_read_date": null, "custom_reading_list": 0, "custom_types": "eBook", "flags": 1, "has_cover": 1, "id": 437, "identifier_ids": "1264,1265", "identifiers": [{"book": 437, "id": 1265, "name": "ISBN", "path": "https://www.worldcat.org/isbn/9780553577129", "sort": "isbn", "type": "isbn", "val": "9780553577129"}, {"book": 437, "id": 1264, "name": "Google Books", "path": "https://books.google.com/books?id=Z-SoMQEACAAJ", "sort": "google", "type": "google", "val": "Z-SoMQEACAAJ"}], "isbn": "9780553577129", "language_ids": "1", "languages": [{"avg_rating": 8.429245283018869, "count": 341, "id": 1, "name": "ENG", "sort": "ENG"}], "last_modified": "2023-07-21 14:29:11.123443+00:00", "order_by": "2020-03-03 23:00:00+00:00", "path": "Anne Frank/The Diary of a Young Girl_ The Defi (437)", "pubdate": "1997-07-14", "publisher_ids": "212", "publishers": [{"avg_rating": 8.0, "count": 1, "id": 212, "name": "Bantam Books", "sort": "Bantam Books"}], "rating": 4, "series": [], "series_ids": null, "size": 480624, "tag_ids": "60,428,438,439", "tags": [{"avg_rating": 8.363636363636363, "count": 24, "id": 60, "name": "History", "sort": 24}, {"avg_rating": 9.0, "count": 2, "id": 428, "name": "Holocaust", "sort": 2}, {"avg_rating": 8.0, "count": 1, "id": 438, "name": "Holocaust; Jewish", "sort": 1}, {"avg_rating": 8.0, "count": 1, "id": 439, "name": "Netherlands", "sort": 1}], "timestamp": "2020-03-03 23:00:00+00:00", "title": "The Diary of a Young Girl: The Definitive Edition"}, {"author_ids": "480", "authors": [{"avg_rating": 8.0, "count": 1, "id": 480, "name": "Charles Dickens", "sort": "Dickens, Charles"}], "comments": "\u003cdiv\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCharles Dickens\u0027s \u003cem\u003eA Tale of Two Cities\u003c/em\u003e portrays a world on fire, split between Paris and London during the brutal and bloody events of the French Revolution.

From the tranquil lanes of London, they are all drawn against their will to the vengeful, bloodstained streets of Paris at the height of the Reign of Terror and soon fall under the lethal shadow of La Guillotine.

An acronym for \"Phenethylamines I Have Known and Loved\", the book spans autobiography, organic chemistry, politics, ethnobotany, and psychopharmacology, and the cultural impact is likely to be profound for decades to come, as it has already. PiHKAL is divided into two parts, the first of which is a fictionalized autobiographical \u0027novel\u0027 - the main fiction is that it is fiction. This first half of the book is The Love Story, about two people named Shura and Alice who fall in love, though one of them is already in love with someone else. This love triangle is a painful ordeal they must go through, and that process unfolds before the reader with grace and great insight into human nature. Shura is a brilliant chemist who has dedicated his career to making psychoactive drugs, in the story they go through many experiences with the psychedelic compounds that Shura has discovered and has made in his lab, all of which have been bioassayed himself. The reader will find themselves going on this journey with them, experiencing what they experienced, both in their hearts and in the psychedelic journeys they have. The second half of PiHKAL is called The Chemical Story, and it contains detailed instructions for, and effects of, the synthesis of 179 psychedelic phenethylamines which were mostly discovered by Shulgin himself. For each substance there is information on its synthesis, suggested effective dosage, duration, and detailed commentary on the subjective effects that were experienced.

Scott Fitzgerald that follows a cast of characters living in the fictional town of West Egg on prosperous Long Island in the summer of 1922. The story primarily concerns the young and mysterious millionaire Jay Gatsby and his quixotic passion and obsession for the beautiful former debutante Daisy Buchanan. Considered to be Fitzgerald\u0027s magnum opus, The Great Gatsby explores themes of decadence, idealism, resistance to change, social upheaval, and excess, creating a portrait of the Jazz Age or the Roaring Twenties that has been described as a cautionary tale regarding the American Dream. Fitzgerald-inspired by the parties he had attended while visiting Long Island\u0027s north shore-began planning the novel in 1923, desiring to produce, in his words, \"something new-something extraordinary and beautiful and simple and intricately patterned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\" Progress was slow, with Fitzgerald completing his first draft following a move to the French Riviera in 1924. His editor, Maxwell Perkins, felt the book was vague and persuaded the author to revise over the next winter. Fitzgerald was repeatedly ambivalent about the book\u0027s title and he considered a variety of alternatives, including titles that referenced the Roman character Trimalchio; the title he was last documented to have desired was Under the Red, White, and Blue. In its first year, the book sold only 20,000 copies. Fitzgerald died in 1940, believing himself to be a failure and his work forgotten. However, the novel experienced a revival during World War II, and became a part of American high school curricula and numerous stage and film adaptations in the following decades. Today, The Great Gatsby is widely considered to be a literary classic and a contender for the title \"Great American Novel\". In 1998, the Modern Library editorial board voted it the 20th century\u0027s best American novel and second best English-language novel of the same time period.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e", "custom_clean": 1, "custom_lists": [{"id": 6, "sort": "Must Read.10 Greatest Books of All Time", "value": "Must Read.10 Greatest Books of All Time"}, {"id": 7, "sort": "Gutenberg Collection", "value": "Gutenberg Collection"}], "custom_lists_ids": "6,7", "custom_read_date": null, "custom_reading_list": 0, "custom_types": "eBook", "flags": 1, "has_cover": 1, "id": 211, "identifier_ids": "771,768,769,770", "identifiers": [{"book": 211, "id": 770, "name": "ISBN", "path": "https://www.worldcat.org/isbn/9789176371213", "sort": "isbn", "type": "isbn", "val": "9789176371213"}, {"book": 211, "id": 769, "name": "Gutenberg", "path": "http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/64317", "sort": "gutenberg", "type": "gutenberg", "val": "64317"}, {"book": 211, "id": 768, "name": "Google Books", "path": "https://books.google.com/books?id=u-OCjwEACAAJ", "sort": "google", "type": "google", "val": "u-OCjwEACAAJ"}, {"book": 211, "id": 771, "name": "Goodreads", "path": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28787401", "sort": "goodreads", "type": "goodreads", "val": "28787401"}], "isbn": "9789176371213", "language_ids": "1", "languages": [{"avg_rating": 8.429245283018869, "count": 341, "id": 1, "name": "ENG", "sort": "ENG"}], "last_modified": "2023-05-04 17:55:52.136675+00:00", "order_by": "2022-10-10 14:39:37.098030+00:00", "path": "F.

Living Down and Out in Paris and London , repudiating respectable imperialist society, and reinventing himself as George Orwell. His 1933 debut book (ostensibly a novel, but overwhelmingly autobiographical) was rejected by that elitist publisher T. S. Eliot, perhaps because its close-up portrait of lowlife was too pungent for comfort.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn Paris, Orwell lived in verminous rooms and washed dishes at the overpriced \"Hotel X,\" in a remarkably filthy, 110-degree kitchen. He met \"eccentric people \u2013 people who have fallen into solitary, half-mad grooves of life and given up trying to be normal or decent.\" Though Orwell\u0027s tone is that of an outraged reformer, it\u0027s surprising how entertaining many of his adventures are: gnawing poverty only enlivens the imagination, and the wild characters he met often swindled each other and themselves. The wackiest tale involves a miser who ate cats, wore newspapers for underwear, invested 6,000 francs in cocaine, and hid it in a face-powder tin when the cops raided. They had to free him, because the apparently controlled substance turned out to be face powder instead of cocaine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn London, Orwell studied begging with a crippled expert named Bozo, a great storyteller and philosopher. Orwell devotes a chapter to the fine points of London guttersnipe slang. Years later, he would put his lexical bent to work by inventing Newspeak, and draw on his down-and-out experience to evoke the plight of the Proles in 1984. Though marred by hints of unexamined anti-Semitism, Orwell\u0027s debut remains, as The Nation put it, \"the most lucid portrait of poverty in the English language.\" --Tim Appelo\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e", "custom_clean": 1, "custom_lists": [], "custom_lists_ids": null, "custom_read_date": null, "custom_reading_list": 0, "custom_types": "eBook", "flags": 1, "has_cover": 1, "id": 159, "identifier_ids": "483,484,481,482", "identifiers": [{"book": 159, "id": 482, "name": "ISBN", "path": "https://www.worldcat.org/isbn/9780156262248", "sort": "isbn", "type": "isbn", "val": "9780156262248"}, {"book": 159, "id": 481, "name": "Google Books", "path": "https://books.google.com/books?id=m5vIVN7LjtgC", "sort": "google", "type": "google", "val": "m5vIVN7LjtgC"}, {"book": 159, "id": 484, "name": "Goodreads", "path": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34304872", "sort": "goodreads", "type": "goodreads", "val": "34304872"}, {"book": 159, "id": 483, "name": "Amazon", "path": "https://amazon.com/dp/015626224X", "sort": "amazon", "type": "amazon", "val": "015626224X"}], "isbn": "9780156262248", "language_ids": "1", "languages": [{"avg_rating": 8.429245283018869, "count": 341, "id": 1, "name": "ENG", "sort": "ENG"}], "last_modified": "2023-05-04 17:55:52.136675+00:00", "order_by": "2022-10-06 09:35:53.313990+00:00", "path": "George Orwell/Down and Out in Paris and London (159)", "pubdate": "1933-01-01", "publisher_ids": "90", "publishers": [{"avg_rating": 8.8, "count": 20, "id": 90, "name": "Penguin Random House", "sort": "Penguin Random House"}], "rating": 4, "series": [], "series_ids": null, "size": 690052, "tag_ids": "57,60,90,92,153", "tags": [{"avg_rating": 8.222222222222221, "count": 31, "id": 92, "name": "Biography", "sort": 31}, {"avg_rating": 8.578947368421053, "count": 28, "id": 153, "name": "Classics", "sort": 28}, {"avg_rating": 8.363636363636363, "count": 24, "id": 60, "name": "History", "sort": 24}, {"avg_rating": 8.347826086956522, "count": 23, "id": 57, "name": "Politics", "sort": 23}, {"avg_rating": 7.5, "count": 4, "id": 90, "name": "Travel", "sort": 4}], "timestamp": "2022-10-06 09:35:53.313990+00:00", "title": "Down and Out in Paris and London"}, {"author_ids": "166", "authors": [{"avg_rating": 8.0, "count": 1, "id": 166, "name": "John Kennedy Toole", "sort": "Toole, John Kennedy"}], "comments": "\u003cdiv\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReleased by Louisiana State University Press in 1980, A Confederacy of Dunces is nothing short of a publishing phenomenon.

No one in her family, in either the United States or Colombia, spoke of infectious diseases, and even into her thirties, she only knew that her aunt had died of a rare illness called Chagas. But as Hern\u00e1ndez dug deeper, she discovered that Chagas\u2014or the kissing bug disease\u2014is more prevalent in the United States than the Zika virus. Today, more than three hundred thousand Americans have Chagas.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy do some infectious diseases make headlines and others fall by the wayside?

She learns that outside of Latin America, the United States is the only country with the native insects\u2014the \"kissing bugs\"\u2014that carry the Chagas parasite. She spends a night in southwest Texas hunting the dreaded bug with university researchers. She also gets to know patients, like a mother whose premature baby was born infected with the parasite, his heart already damaged.

Sullivan, Jr., Washington Post From one of our top historians, a groundbreaking story of policing and \u201criots\u201d that shatters our understanding of the post\u2013civil rights era. What began in spring 2020 as local protests in response to the killing of George Floyd by Minneapolis police quickly exploded into a massive nationwide movement. Millions of mostly young people defiantly flooded into the nation\u2019s streets, demanding an end to police brutality and to the broader, systemic repression of Black people and other people of color. To many observers, the protests appeared to be without precedent in their scale and persistence. Yet, as the acclaimed historian Elizabeth Hinton demonstrates in America on Fire, the events of 2020 had clear precursors\u2014and any attempt to understand our current crisis requires a reckoning with the recent past. Even in the aftermath of Donald Trump, many Americans consider the decades since the civil rights movement in the mid-1960s as a story of progress toward greater inclusiveness and equality. Hinton\u2019s sweeping narrative uncovers an altogether different history, taking us on a troubling journey from Detroit in 1967 and Miami in 1980 to Los Angeles in 1992 and beyond to chart the persistence of structural racism and one of its primary consequences, the so-called urban riot. Hinton offers a critical corrective: the word riot was nothing less than a racist trope applied to events that can only be properly understood as rebellions\u2014explosions of collective resistance to an unequal and violent order. As she suggests, if rebellion and the conditions that precipitated it never disappeared, the optimistic story of a post\u2013Jim Crow United States no longer holds. Black rebellion, America on Fire powerfully illustrates, was born in response to poverty and exclusion, but most immediately in reaction to police violence. In 1968, President Lyndon Johnson launched the \u201cWar on Crime,\u201d sending militarized police forces into impoverished Black neighborhoods. Facing increasing surveillance and brutality, residents threw rocks and Molotov cocktails at officers, plundered local businesses, and vandalized exploitative institutions. Hinton draws on exclusive sources to uncover a previously hidden geography of violence in smaller American cities, from York, Pennsylvania, to Cairo, Illinois, to Stockton, California. The central lesson from these eruptions\u2014that police violence invariably leads to community violence\u2014continues to escape policymakers, who respond by further criminalizing entire groups instead of addressing underlying socioeconomic causes. The results are the hugely expanded policing and prison regimes that shape the lives of so many Americans today. Presenting a new framework for understanding our nation\u2019s enduring strife, America on Fire is also a warning: rebellions will surely continue unless police are no longer called on to manage the consequences of dismal conditions beyond their control, and until an oppressive system is finally remade on the principles of justice and equality.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e", "custom_clean": 1, "custom_lists": [{"id": 5, "sort": "Must Read.2021 Time", "value": "Must Read.2021 Time"}], "custom_lists_ids": "5", "custom_read_date": null, "custom_reading_list": 0, "custom_types": "eBook", "flags": 1, "has_cover": 1, "id": 144, "identifier_ids": "351,352,353", "identifiers": [{"book": 144, "id": 353, "name": "ISBN", "path": "https://www.worldcat.org/isbn/9781631498916", "sort": "isbn", "type": "isbn", "val": "9781631498916"}, {"book": 144, "id": 352, "name": "Google Books", "path": "https://books.google.com/books?id=PAwDEAAAQBAJ", "sort": "google", "type": "google", "val": "PAwDEAAAQBAJ"}, {"book": 144, "id": 351, "name": "Goodreads", "path": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/55298326", "sort": "goodreads", "type": "goodreads", "val": "55298326"}], "isbn": "9781631498916", "language_ids": "1", "languages": [{"avg_rating": 8.429245283018869, "count": 341, "id": 1, "name": "ENG", "sort": "ENG"}], "last_modified": "2023-05-04 17:55:52.136675+00:00", "order_by": "2022-10-05 15:54:15.142378+00:00", "path": "Elizabeth Hinton/America on Fire_ The Untold History (144)", "pubdate": "2021-05-18", "publisher_ids": "84", "publishers": [{"avg_rating": 8.0, "count": 4, "id": 84, "name": "Liveright Publishing", "sort": "Liveright Publishing"}], "rating": 4, "series": [], "series_ids": null, "size": 12900649, "tag_ids": "57,60,194", "tags": [{"avg_rating": 8.333333333333334, "count": 40, "id": 194, "name": "Time", "sort": 40}, {"avg_rating": 8.363636363636363, "count": 24, "id": 60, "name": "History", "sort": 24}, {"avg_rating": 8.347826086956522, "count": 23, "id": 57, "name": "Politics", "sort": 23}], "timestamp": "2022-10-05 15:54:15.142378+00:00", "title": "America on Fire: The Untold History of Police Violence and Black Rebellion Since the 1960s"}, {"author_ids": "145", "authors": [{"avg_rating": 8.0, "count": 1, "id": 145, "name": "Elizabeth Kolbert", "sort": "Kolbert, Elizabeth"}], "comments": "\u003cdiv\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNATIONAL BESTSELLER * The Pulitzer Prize-winning author of The Sixth Extinction returns to humanity\u0027s transformative impact on the environment, now asking: After doing so much damage, can we change nature, this time to save it?

So pervasive are human impacts on the planet that it\u0027s said we live in a new geological epoch: the Anthropocene. In Under a White Sky, Elizabeth Kolbert takes a hard look at the new world we are creating. Along the way, she meets biologists who are trying to preserve the world\u0027s rarest fish, which lives in a single tiny pool in the middle of the Mojave; engineers who are turning carbon emissions to stone in Iceland; Australian researchers who are trying to develop a \"super coral\" that can survive on a hotter globe; and physicists who are contemplating shooting tiny diamonds into the stratosphere to cool the earth. One way to look at human civilization, says Kolbert, is as a ten-thousand-year exercise in defying nature. In The Sixth Extinction, she explored the ways in which our capacity for destruction has reshaped the natural world. Now she examines how the very sorts of interventions that have imperiled our planet are increasingly seen as the only hope for its salvation. By turns inspiring, terrifying, and darkly comic, Under a White Sky is an utterly original examination of the challenges we face.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e", "custom_clean": 1, "custom_lists": [{"id": 5, "sort": "Must Read.2021 Time", "value": "Must Read.2021 Time"}], "custom_lists_ids": "5", "custom_read_date": null, "custom_reading_list": 0, "custom_types": "eBook", "flags": 1, "has_cover": 1, "id": 143, "identifier_ids": "462,461,460,459", "identifiers": [{"book": 143, "id": 459, "name": "ISBN", "path": "https://www.worldcat.org/isbn/9780593136287", "sort": "isbn", "type": "isbn", "val": "9780593136287"}, {"book": 143, "id": 460, "name": "Google Books", "path": "https://books.google.com/books?id=qwpjEAAAQBAJ", "sort": "google", "type": "google", "val": "qwpjEAAAQBAJ"}, {"book": 143, "id": 461, "name": "Goodreads", "path": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/60757903", "sort": "goodreads", "type": "goodreads", "val": "60757903"}, {"book": 143, "id": 462, "name": "Amazon", "path": "https://amazon.com/dp/B08DMWR6BP", "sort": "amazon", "type": "amazon", "val": "B08DMWR6BP"}], "isbn": "9780593136287", "language_ids": "1", "languages": [{"avg_rating": 8.429245283018869, "count": 341, "id": 1, "name": "ENG", "sort": "ENG"}], "last_modified": "2023-05-04 17:55:52.136675+00:00", "order_by": "2022-10-05 15:54:14.761371+00:00", "path": "Elizabeth Kolbert/Under a White Sky_ The Nature of th (143)", "pubdate": "2021-02-09", "publisher_ids": "100", "publishers": [{"avg_rating": 8.0, "count": 6, "id": 100, "name": "Crown Publishing Group", "sort": "Crown Publishing Group"}], "rating": 4, "series": [], "series_ids": null, "size": 4317039, "tag_ids": "57,58,60,125,194,253", "tags": [{"avg_rating": 8.333333333333334, "count": 40, "id": 194, "name": "Time", "sort": 40}, {"avg_rating": 8.363636363636363, "count": 24, "id": 60, "name": "History", "sort": 24}, {"avg_rating": 8.347826086956522, "count": 23, "id": 57, "name": "Politics", "sort": 23}, {"avg_rating": 8.222222222222221, "count": 11, "id": 58, "name": "Science", "sort": 11}, {"avg_rating": 8.0, "count": 2, "id": 253, "name": "Non-Fiction", "sort": 2}, {"avg_rating": 8.0, "count": 1, "id": 125, "name": "Climate Crisis", "sort": 1}], "timestamp": "2022-10-05 15:54:14.761371+00:00", "title": "Under a White Sky: The Nature of the Future"}, {"author_ids": "144", "authors": [{"avg_rating": 8.0, "count": 1, "id": 144, "name": "Gabriel Krauze", "sort": "Krauze, Gabriel"}], "comments": "\u003cdiv\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLonglisted for the Booker Prize 2020 A Spectator Book of the Year \u0027A literary rendering of the Top Boy generation...

Nobody, including the lawmakers who passed the bill, expected it to transform the country\u2019s demographics. But over the next four decades, millions arrived, including Jay Caspian Kang\u2019s parents, grandparents, aunts, and uncles. They came with almost no understanding of their new home, much less the history of \u201cAsian America\u201d that was supposed to define them.\u00a0The Loneliest Americans is the unforgettable story of Kang and his family as they move from a housing project in Cambridge to an idyllic college town in the South and eventually to the West Coast.

One morning, when Kat was nine, her mother, a vivacious and mischievous woman, casually made a morbid joke: When she eventually dies, she said laughing, she\u0027d like to be stuffed and displayed in Kat\u0027s future apartment in order to always watch over her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFour years later when her mother dies unexpectedly from cancer, Kat, her two older sisters, and their father are plunged into a debilitating, lonely grief.

Pop Song is a book about love and about falling in love\u2014with a place, or a painting, or a person\u2014and the joy and terror inherent in the experience of that love. Plumbing the well of culture for clues and patterns about love and loss\u2014from Agnes Martin\u0027s abstract paintings to James Turrell\u0027s transcendent light works, and Anne Carson\u0027s Eros the Bittersweet to Frank Ocean\u0027s Blonde\u2014Pham writes of her youthful attempts to find meaning in travel, sex, drugs, and art, before sensing that she might need to turn her gaze upon herself. Pop Song is also a book about distances, near and far. As she travels from Taos, New Mexico, to Shanghai, China and beyond, Pham meditates on the miles we are willing to cover to get away from ourselves, or those who hurt us, and the impossible gaps that can exist between two people sharing a bed. Pop Song is a book about all the routes by which we might escape our own needs before finally finding a way home. There is heartache in these pages, but Pham\u0027s electric ways of seeing create a perfectly fractured portrait of modern intimacy that is triumphant in both its vulnerability and restlessness. \"Each of the essays in this debut collection reads like a mini-memoir ... in which the author reflects on her experiences of young love, trauma, and transcendence through discussions of art and music ... with an intimacy that is at once tender and expansive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\" \u2014New York magazine\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e", "custom_clean": 1, "custom_lists": [{"id": 5, "sort": "Must Read.2021 Time", "value": "Must Read.2021 Time"}], "custom_lists_ids": "5", "custom_read_date": null, "custom_reading_list": 0, "custom_types": "eBook", "flags": 1, "has_cover": 1, "id": 133, "identifier_ids": "320,318,319", "identifiers": [{"book": 133, "id": 319, "name": "ISBN", "path": "https://www.worldcat.org/isbn/9781646220274", "sort": "isbn", "type": "isbn", "val": "9781646220274"}, {"book": 133, "id": 318, "name": "Google Books", "path": "https://books.google.com/books?id=V6UQEAAAQBAJ", "sort": "google", "type": "google", "val": "V6UQEAAAQBAJ"}, {"book": 133, "id": 320, "name": "Goodreads", "path": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/60057391", "sort": "goodreads", "type": "goodreads", "val": "60057391"}], "isbn": "9781646220274", "language_ids": "1", "languages": [{"avg_rating": 8.429245283018869, "count": 341, "id": 1, "name": "ENG", "sort": "ENG"}], "last_modified": "2023-05-04 17:55:52.136675+00:00", "order_by": "2022-10-05 15:54:11.131714+00:00", "path": "Larissa Pham/Pop Song_ Adventures in Art \u0026 Intim (133)", "pubdate": "2021-05-04", "publisher_ids": "77", "publishers": [{"avg_rating": 8.0, "count": 1, "id": 77, "name": "Catapult", "sort": "Catapult"}], "rating": 4, "series": [], "series_ids": null, "size": 1035488, "tag_ids": "44,49,92,132,133,194", "tags": [{"avg_rating": 8.89655172413793, "count": 51, "id": 49, "name": "Contemporary", "sort": 51}, {"avg_rating": 8.333333333333334, "count": 40, "id": 194, "name": "Time", "sort": 40}, {"avg_rating": 8.222222222222221, "count": 31, "id": 92, "name": "Biography", "sort": 31}, {"avg_rating": 8.0, "count": 6, "id": 44, "name": "Art", "sort": 6}, {"avg_rating": 7.6, "count": 6, "id": 132, "name": "Music", "sort": 6}, {"avg_rating": 8.333333333333334, "count": 6, "id": 133, "name": "Feminism", "sort": 6}], "timestamp": "2022-10-05 15:54:11.131714+00:00", "title": "Pop Song: Adventures in Art \u0026 Intimacy"}, {"author_ids": "134", "authors": [{"avg_rating": 8.0, "count": 1, "id": 134, "name": "Louis Menand", "sort": "Menand, Louis"}], "comments": "\u003cdiv\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"An engrossing and impossibly wide-ranging project ...

It was also about ideas, in the broadest sense\u2014economic and political, artistic and personal. In The Free World, the acclaimed Pulitzer Prize\u2013winning scholar and critic Louis Menand tells the story of American culture in the pivotal years from the end of World War II to Vietnam and shows how changing economic, technological, and social forces put their mark on creations of the mind. How did elitism and an anti-totalitarian skepticism of passion and ideology give way to a new sensibility defined by freewheeling experimentation and loving the Beatles? How was the ideal of \u201cfreedom\u201d applied to causes that ranged from anti-communism and civil rights to radical acts of self-creation via art and even crime? With the wit and insight familiar to readers of The Metaphysical Club and his New Yorker essays, Menand takes us inside Hannah Arendt\u2019s Manhattan, the Paris of Jean-Paul Sartre and Simone de Beauvoir, Merce Cunningham and John Cage\u2019s residencies at North Carolina\u2019s Black Mountain College, and the Memphis studio where Sam Phillips and Elvis Presley created a new music for the American teenager. He examines the post war vogue for French existentialism, structuralism and post-structuralism, the rise of abstract expressionism and pop art, Allen Ginsberg\u2019s friendship with Lionel Trilling, James Baldwin\u2019s transformation into a Civil Right spokesman, Susan Sontag\u2019s challenges to the New York Intellectuals, the defeat of obscenity laws, and the rise of the New Hollywood. Stressing the rich flow of ideas across the Atlantic, he also shows how Europeans played a vital role in promoting and influencing American art and entertainment.

Next he directed four consecutive hit plays, won back-to-back Tonys, ushered in a new era of Hollywood moviemaking with Who\u0027s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?, and followed it with The Graduate, which won him an Oscar and became the third-highest-grossing movie ever. At thirty-five, he lived in a three-story Central Park West penthouse, drove a Rolls-Royce, collected Arabian horses, and counted Jacqueline Kennedy, Elizabeth Taylor, Leonard Bernstein, and Richard Avedon as friends.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhere he arrived is even more astonishing given where he had begun: born Igor Peschkowsky to a Jewish couple in Berlin in 1931, he was sent along with his younger brother to America on a ship in 1939.

He was bullied and ostracized--an allergic reaction had rendered him permanently hairless--and his father died when he was just twelve, leaving his mother alone and overwhelmed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe gulf between these two sets of facts explains a great deal about Nichols\u0027s transformation from lonely outsider to the center of more than one cultural universe--the acute powers of observation that first made him famous; the nourishment he drew from his creative partnerships, most enduringly with May; his unquenchable drive; his hunger for security and status; and the depressions and self-medications that brought him to terrible lows. It would take decades for him to come to grips with his demons. In an incomparable portrait that follows Nichols from Berlin to New York to Chicago to Hollywood, Mark Harris explores, with brilliantly vivid detail and insight, the life, work, struggle, and passion of an artist and man in constant motion. Among the 250 people Harris interviewed: Elaine May, Meryl Streep, Stephen Sondheim, Robert Redford, Glenn Close, Tom Hanks, Candice Bergen, Emma Thompson, Annette Bening, Natalie Portman, Julia Roberts, Lorne Michaels, and Gloria Steinem.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMark Harris gives an intimate and evenhanded accounting of success and failure alike; the portrait is not always flattering, but its ultimate impact is to present the full story of one of the most richly interesting, complicated, and consequential figures the worlds of theater and motion pictures have ever seen.

As she shows, the murder of the Indigenous man set the entire mid-Atlantic on edge, with many believing war was imminent. Isolated killings often flared into colonial wars in North America, and colonists now anticipated a vengeful Indigenous uprising. Frantic efforts to resolve the case ignited a dramatic, far-reaching debate between Native American forms of justice\u2014centered on community, forgiveness, and reparations\u2014and an ideology of harsh reprisal, unique to the colonies and based on British law, which called for the killers\u2019 swift execution.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn charting the far-reaching ramifications of the murder, Covered with Night \u2014a phrase from Iroquois mourning practices\u2014overturns persistent assumptions about \u201ccivilized\u201d Europeans and \u201csavage\u201d Native Americans.

Very soon he\u0027s lured from his duties into a hunt for a fantastic treasure discovered by archaeologists and carefully hushed up. The long-vanished Martians who once colonised the galaxy have left a buried hyperspace gateway leading to a working starship in distant orbit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKovacs uses frightening violence to get the attention of corporate sponsors even more ruthless than himself. His hastily assembled exploration team must work in a lethal fallout zone, racing to open the gate before they\u0027re stopped by radiation sickness, treacherous sabotage, or the threat of fast-evolving nanoweaponry. And there are repeated hints that if they ever make it through that gateway, worse things are waiting on the far side...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0027s all desperately tense and crafted with appalling inventiveness. Life is cheap and death is no release, because the \"cortical stack\" implanted in everyone\u0027s spine constantly records the total personality, ready for \"re-sleeving\" in a new clone body or storage in virtual reality. So Kovacs goes recruiting at the macabre Soul Market, where thanks to the war there are literal skiploads of hacked-out sections of human spine containing stacks--for sale by the kilogram.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOther ingredients include sex, voodoo, torture, multiple betrayal, cool military technology, incomprehensible alien constructions, age-old cycles of catastrophe, and--above all--extreme violence. The screw is turned further and further, beyond what seems possible. Readers may find themselves forgetting to breathe. This is a rattling good yarn, for the strong of stomach. --David Langford\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e", "custom_clean": 1, "custom_lists": [], "custom_lists_ids": null, "custom_read_date": "2022-06-08", "custom_reading_list": 0, "custom_types": "eBook", "flags": 1, "has_cover": 1, "id": 75, "identifier_ids": "169,168,166,167", "identifiers": [{"book": 75, "id": 167, "name": "ISBN", "path": "https://www.worldcat.org/isbn/9780575075504", "sort": "isbn", "type": "isbn", "val": "9780575075504"}, {"book": 75, "id": 166, "name": "Google Books", "path": "https://books.google.com/books?id=H_FyPwAACAAJ", "sort": "google", "type": "google", "val": "H_FyPwAACAAJ"}, {"book": 75, "id": 168, "name": "Goodreads", "path": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1117988", "sort": "goodreads", "type": "goodreads", "val": "1117988"}, {"book": 75, "id": 169, "name": "Amazon", "path": "https://amazon.com/dp/0345457714", "sort": "amazon", "type": "amazon", "val": "0345457714"}], "isbn": "9780575075504", "language_ids": "1", "languages": [{"avg_rating": 8.429245283018869, "count": 341, "id": 1, "name": "ENG", "sort": "ENG"}], "last_modified": "2022-10-06 17:19:38.709950+00:00", "order_by": "2022-10-04 19:29:45.875671+00:00", "path": "Richard K.

Kovacs can deal with the madness of AI. He can do his part in a battle against biomachines gone wild, search for a three-centuries-old missing weapons system, and live with a blood feud with the yakuza, and even with the betrayal of people he once trusted. But when his relationship with \u201cthe\u201d Falconer brings him an enemy specially designed to destroy him, he knows it\u2019s time to be afraid.

It Doesn\u0027t Have to Be Crazy at Work is a direct successor to Rework, the instant bestseller that showed readers a new path to working effectively. Now Fried and Heinemeier Hansson have returned with a new strategy for the ideal company culture - what they call the calm company . It is a direct attack on the chaos, anxiety and stress that plagues millions of workplaces and billions of people working their day jobs. Working to breaking point with long hours, excessive workload, and a lack of sleep have become a badge of honour for many people these days, when it should be a mark of stupidity. This isn\u0027t just a problem for large organisations; individuals, contractors and solopreneurs are burning themselves out in the very same way. As the authors reveal, the answer isn\u0027t more hours. Rather, it\u0027s less waste and fewer things that induce distraction, always-on anxiety and stress. It is time to stop celebrating crazy and start celebrating calm. Fried and Hansson have the proof to back up their argument. Calm has been the cornerstone of their company\u0027s culture since Basecamp began twenty years ago.

When we bring both respect and interpersonal savvy to our work relationships, we do more than make people feel good. We enhance personal and organizational performance. And as the workplace grows more complex and competitive, managing our work relationships becomes even more essential and difficult. Now more than ever we need to work people smart. Working PeopleSmart describes the six core strategies used by people-smart individuals and shows how to apply them in the toughest workplace situations. Individuals who are people smart know how to open others up rather than make them defensive or resistant. They have a knack for diffusing tension rather than creating it. They set a good example through their own behavior on the job and can inspire and influence others with less developed skills. Working PeopleSmart can serve as your virtual coach to guide you through difficult work relationships skillfully. How do you deal with a critical colleague? Make your boss listen to you? React to an offensive joke? Get the resources you need? The authors look at over 50 real-life situations and offer people-smart prescriptions for handling them effectively. They provide coaching tips for each scenario and describe exactly what a people-smart response sounds like. As two psychologists with both organizational and clinical expertise, coauthors Mel Silberman and Freda Hansburg are highly qualified to deliver the message that we can emerge from even the toughest interpersonal moments on the job with dignity and grace. Where other books rely on typologies that categorize people according to their interpersonal styles and then offer advice on how to deal with each type, the strategies described in Working PeopleSmart are straightforward and universal. They can be used immediately to deal with any type of person or any situation, no matter how difficult or sensitive.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e", "custom_clean": 1, "custom_lists": [], "custom_lists_ids": null, "custom_read_date": null, "custom_reading_list": 0, "custom_types": "eBook", "flags": 1, "has_cover": 1, "id": 34, "identifier_ids": "122,121,123", "identifiers": [{"book": 34, "id": 123, "name": "ISBN", "path": "https://www.worldcat.org/isbn/9781576752081", "sort": "isbn", "type": "isbn", "val": "9781576752081"}, {"book": 34, "id": 121, "name": "Google Books", "path": "https://books.google.com/books?id=YZgNngEACAAJ", "sort": "google", "type": "google", "val": "YZgNngEACAAJ"}, {"book": 34, "id": 122, "name": "Goodreads", "path": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1946690", "sort": "goodreads", "type": "goodreads", "val": "1946690"}], "isbn": "9781576752081", "language_ids": "1", "languages": [{"avg_rating": 8.429245283018869, "count": 341, "id": 1, "name": "ENG", "sort": "ENG"}], "last_modified": "2022-10-06 17:19:38.709950+00:00", "order_by": "2022-10-04 13:46:41.441000+00:00", "path": "Melvin L.

Postmaster General Moist von Lipwig, former arch-swindler and confidence man, has exceeded all expectations\u2014including his own.

He\u0027s referring, rather, to the Royal Mint of Ankh-Morpork, a venerable institution that haas run for centuries on the hereditary employment of the Men of the Sheds and their loyal outworkers, who do make money in their spare time.

In the newest appealing installment of the Discworld series, Pratchett (The Truth) takes on religion, time and... kung-fu movies? The cast includes Death; Miss Susan, Death\u0027s granddaughter; Jeremy Clockson, a clockmaker; Lobsang, a novice monk; and Lu-Tze, a sweeper at the temple of the History Monks. When a mysterious lady asks Jeremy to make a clock that is perfectly timed (even to the last tick), trouble begins it seems that such a clock would have the power to stop time completely. There would be no yesterday, no tomorrow, no next minute; in fact, everything and everyone would stop in its tracks. It\u0027s up to Miss Susan, Lobsang and Lu-Tze to figure out who in the end has decided to build the dangerous clock and how to stop him before the world crashes to a halt. Along the way we learn Rule One: \"Do not act incautiously when confronting a little bald wrinkly smiling man,\" which is a very good lesson to learn. We also find out that Lobsang has more in store for his future than to be an apprentice monk. The story includes a quick nod to James Bond flicks with Qu, the monk who supplies gadgets to Lu-Tze and Lobsang, and at the end of Time the four (no, make that five) horsemen of the Apocalypse get to ride out for a jaunt. You don\u0027t need to catch all the in-jokes to enjoy the fun.

Not the way they look, and especially not the way they talk: word-filled balloons come out of their mouths and then disintegrate, leaving dust all over his rug.Eddie will work for a Toon if his cash supply is low enough. So he reluctantly agrees when Roger Rabbit, a Toon who plays straight man (or should that be straight rabbit) in the Baby Herman cartoon series, asks him to find out who\u2019s been trying \u2013 unsuccessfully \u2013 to buy his contract from the DeGreasy Brothers syndicate.Then Rocco DeGreasy is murdered \u2013 and Roger is the prime suspect!

Why had Jessica \u2013 a pretty steamy number for a Toon \u2013 ever married a dopey bunny in the first place?

In 1942, with Nazis occupying Holland, a thirteen-year-old Jewish girl and her family fled their home in Amsterdam and went into hiding. For the next two years, until their whereabouts were betrayed to the Gestapo, they and another family lived cloistered in the \"Secret Annex\" of an old office building. Cut off from the outside world, they faced hunger, boredom, the constant cruelties of living in confined quarters, and the ever-present threat of discovery and death. In her diary Anne Frank recorded vivid impressions of her experiences during this period. By turns thoughtful, moving, and amusing, her account offers a fascinating commentary on human courage and frailty and a compelling self-portrait of a sensitive and spirited young woman whose promise was tragically cut short.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e", "custom_clean": 1, "custom_lists": [{"id": 14, "sort": "Must Read.25 Must Read", "value": "Must Read.25 Must Read"}], "custom_lists_ids": "14", "custom_read_date": null, "custom_reading_list": 0, "custom_types": "eBook", "flags": 1, "has_cover": 1, "id": 437, "identifier_ids": "1264,1265", "identifiers": [{"book": 437, "id": 1265, "name": "ISBN", "path": "https://www.worldcat.org/isbn/9780553577129", "sort": "isbn", "type": "isbn", "val": "9780553577129"}, {"book": 437, "id": 1264, "name": "Google Books", "path": "https://books.google.com/books?id=Z-SoMQEACAAJ", "sort": "google", "type": "google", "val": "Z-SoMQEACAAJ"}], "isbn": "9780553577129", "language_ids": "1", "languages": [{"avg_rating": 8.429245283018869, "count": 341, "id": 1, "name": "ENG", "sort": "ENG"}], "last_modified": "2023-07-21 14:29:11.123443+00:00", "order_by": "2020-03-03 23:00:00+00:00", "path": "Anne Frank/The Diary of a Young Girl_ The Defi (437)", "pubdate": "1997-07-14", "publisher_ids": "212", "publishers": [{"avg_rating": 8.0, "count": 1, "id": 212, "name": "Bantam Books", "sort": "Bantam Books"}], "rating": 4, "series": [], "series_ids": null, "size": 480624, "tag_ids": "60,428,438,439", "tags": [{"avg_rating": 8.363636363636363, "count": 24, "id": 60, "name": "History", "sort": 24}, {"avg_rating": 9.0, "count": 2, "id": 428, "name": "Holocaust", "sort": 2}, {"avg_rating": 8.0, "count": 1, "id": 438, "name": "Holocaust; Jewish", "sort": 1}, {"avg_rating": 8.0, "count": 1, "id": 439, "name": "Netherlands", "sort": 1}], "timestamp": "2020-03-03 23:00:00+00:00", "title": "The Diary of a Young Girl: The Definitive Edition"}, {"author_ids": "480", "authors": [{"avg_rating": 8.0, "count": 1, "id": 480, "name": "Charles Dickens", "sort": "Dickens, Charles"}], "comments": "\u003cdiv\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCharles Dickens\u0027s \u003cem\u003eA Tale of Two Cities\u003c/em\u003e portrays a world on fire, split between Paris and London during the brutal and bloody events of the French Revolution.

From the tranquil lanes of London, they are all drawn against their will to the vengeful, bloodstained streets of Paris at the height of the Reign of Terror and soon fall under the lethal shadow of La Guillotine.

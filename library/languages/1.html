Coding with Kotlin means less hassle. The Kotlin programming language offers an expressive syntax, a strong intuitive type system, and great tooling support along with seamless interoperability with existing Java code, libraries, and frameworks. Kotlin can be compiled to Java bytecode, so you can use it everywhere Java is used, including Android. And with an effi cient compiler and a small standard library, Kotlin imposes virtually no runtime overhead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAbout the Book\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKotlin in Action teaches you to use the Kotlin language for production-quality applications. Written for experienced Java developers, this example-rich book goes further than most language books, covering interesting topics like building DSLs with natural language syntax.

These important advances for security and privacy create new content moderation challenges for online services, because services can no longer directly access plaintext content. While ongoing public policy debates about E2EE and content moderation in the United States and European Union emphasize child sexual abuse material and misinformation in messaging and storage, we identify and synthesize a wealth of scholarship that goes far beyond those topics. We bridge literature that is diverse in both content moderation subject matter, such as malware, spam, hate speech, terrorist content, and enterprise policy compliance, as well as intended deployments, including not only privacy-preserving content moderation for messaging, email, and cloud storage, but also private introspection of encrypted web traffic by middleboxes. In this work, we systematize the study of content moderation in E2EE settings. We set out a process pipeline for content moderation, drawing on a broad interdisciplinary literature that is not specific to E2EE. We examine cryptography and policy design choices at all stages of this pipeline, and we suggest areas of future research to fill gaps in literature and better understand possible paths forward.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e", "custom_clean": 1, "custom_lists": [], "custom_lists_ids": null, "custom_read_date": null, "custom_reading_list": 1, "custom_types": "Paper", "flags": 1, "has_cover": 1, "id": 340, "identifier_ids": "1113", "identifiers": [{"book": 340, "id": 1113, "name": "arXiv", "path": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.03979", "sort": "arxiv", "type": "arxiv", "val": "2303.03979"}], "isbn": null, "language_ids": "1", "languages": [{"avg_rating": 8.429245283018869, "count": 341, "id": 1, "name": "ENG", "sort": "ENG"}], "last_modified": "2023-07-16 18:56:10.618541+00:00", "order_by": "2023-05-23 12:48:00.634174+00:00", "path": "Sarah Scheffler/SoK_ Content Moderation for End-to- (340)", "pubdate": "2023-03-08", "publisher_ids": "125", "publishers": [{"avg_rating": null, "count": 9, "id": 125, "name": "arXiv", "sort": "arXiv"}], "rating": null, "series": [], "series_ids": null, "size": 1598984, "tag_ids": "191,350,351,352", "tags": [{"avg_rating": 7.857142857142857, "count": 28, "id": 191, "name": "Computer Science", "sort": 28}, {"avg_rating": null, "count": 1, "id": 350, "name": "End-to-End Encryption", "sort": 1}, {"avg_rating": null, "count": 1, "id": 351, "name": "Content Moderation", "sort": 1}, {"avg_rating": null, "count": 1, "id": 352, "name": "Privacy", "sort": 1}], "timestamp": "2023-05-23 12:48:00.634174+00:00", "title": "SoK: Content Moderation for End-to-End Encryption"}, {"author_ids": "379,380", "authors": [{"avg_rating": 8.0, "count": 1, "id": 380, "name": "Sophie Debenedetto", "sort": "Debenedetto, Sophie"}, {"avg_rating": 8.0, "count": 1, "id": 379, "name": "Bruce A.

Upgrade your web API to GraphQL, leveraging its flexible queries to empower your users, and its declarative structure to simplify your code. Absinthe is the GraphQL toolkit for Elixir, a functional programming language designed to enable massive concurrency atop robust application architectures. Written by the creators of Absinthe, this book will help you take full advantage of these two groundbreaking technologies. Build your own flexible, high-performance APIs using step-by-step guidance and expert advice you won\u0027t find anywhere else. GraphQL is a new way of structuring and building web services, and the result is transformational. Find out how to offer a more tailored, cohesive experience to your users, easily aggregate data from different data sources, and improve your back end\u0027s maintainability with Absinthe\u0027s declarative approach to defining how your API works. Build a GraphQL-based API from scratch using Absinthe, starting from core principles. Learn the type system and how to expand your schema to suit your application\u0027s needs. Discover a growing ecosystem of tools and utilities to understand, debug, and document your API. Take it to production, but do it safely with solid best practices in mind. Find out how complexity analysis and persisted queries can let you support your users flexibly, but responsibly too. Along the way, discover how Elixir makes all the difference for a high performance, fault-tolerant API. Use asynchronous and batching execution, or write your own custom add-ons to extend Absinthe. Go live with subscriptions, delivering data over websockets on top of Elixir (and Erlang/OTP\u0027s) famous solid performance and real-time capabilities. Transform your applications with the powerful combination of Elixir and GraphQL, using Absinthe. What You Need: To follow along with the book, you should have Erlang/OTP 19+ and Elixir 1.4+ installed.

Sigmund Freud is an Austrian neurologist and the founding father of psychoanalysis, a method for treating mental illness and also a theory that explains human behavior. Freud believed that events in our childhood hold a great impact on our adult lives, shaping our personality. In creating psychoanalysis, Freud designed therapeutic techniques such as the use of free association and discovered transference, establishing its central role in the analytic process. Freud saw that man is at war with himself and often unable to tolerate too much reality. He propounded the theory that dreams are the contraband representations of the beast within man, smuggled into awareness during sleep. In Freudian interpretation, the analysis of dreams is the key to unlocking the secrets of the unconscious mind.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e", "custom_clean": 1, "custom_lists": [{"id": 7, "sort": "Gutenberg Collection", "value": "Gutenberg Collection"}], "custom_lists_ids": "7", "custom_read_date": null, "custom_reading_list": 0, "custom_types": "eBook", "flags": 1, "has_cover": 1, "id": 275, "identifier_ids": "926,924,925", "identifiers": [{"book": 275, "id": 925, "name": "ISBN", "path": "https://www.worldcat.org/isbn/9789354992926", "sort": "isbn", "type": "isbn", "val": "9789354992926"}, {"book": 275, "id": 924, "name": "Gutenberg", "path": "http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/66048", "sort": "gutenberg", "type": "gutenberg", "val": "66048"}, {"book": 275, "id": 926, "name": "Google Books", "path": "https://books.google.com/books?id=VeI6zwEACAAJ", "sort": "google", "type": "google", "val": "VeI6zwEACAAJ"}], "isbn": "9789354992926", "language_ids": "1", "languages": [{"avg_rating": 8.429245283018869, "count": 341, "id": 1, "name": "ENG", "sort": "ENG"}], "last_modified": "2023-07-16 20:11:13.407698+00:00", "order_by": "2023-03-16 22:04:27.128124+00:00", "path": "Sigmund Freud/The Interpretation of Dreams (275)", "pubdate": "2021-06-10", "publisher_ids": "176", "publishers": [{"avg_rating": null, "count": 1, "id": 176, "name": "General Press", "sort": "General Press"}], "rating": null, "series": [], "series_ids": null, "size": 889821, "tag_ids": "31,214,271,272", "tags": [{"avg_rating": 8.0, "count": 20, "id": 31, "name": "Psychology", "sort": 20}, {"avg_rating": 7.666666666666667, "count": 14, "id": 214, "name": "Gutenberg", "sort": 14}, {"avg_rating": null, "count": 1, "id": 271, "name": "Dream interpretation", "sort": 1}, {"avg_rating": null, "count": 1, "id": 272, "name": "Psychoanalysis", "sort": 1}], "timestamp": "2023-03-16 22:04:27.128124+00:00", "title": "The Interpretation of Dreams"}, {"author_ids": "364", "authors": [{"avg_rating": null, "count": 2, "id": 364, "name": "Sally Rooney", "sort": "Rooney, Sally"}], "comments": "\u003cdiv\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNormal People is a story of mutual fascination, friendship and love.

The author pulls from her experience with Silicon Valley\u2019s hottest companies to teach practical insights on OKRs in the form of a fable.When Hanna and Jack receive an ultimatum from the only investor in their struggling tea supply company, they must learn how to employ Objectives and Key Results (OKRs) with radical focus to get the right things done. Using Hanna and Jack\u2019s story, Wodtke walks readers through how to inspire a diverse team to work together in pursuit of a single, challenging goal, and how to stay motivated despite setbacks and failures.Radical Focus has been translated into six languages and sold more than 50,000 copies.

He\u0027s worked with celebrated chef Eric Ripert as wine director of three-Michelin-starred Le Bernardin for over a decade, yet his philosophy and approach to wine is much more casual. Aldo\u0027s debut book, Wine Simple, is full of confidence-building infographics and illustrations, an unbeatable depth of knowledge, effusive encouragement, and, most important, strong opinions on wine so you can learn to form your own. Imbued with Aldo\u0027s insatiable passion and eagerness to teach others, Wine Simple is accessible, deeply educational, and lively and fun, both in voice and visuals. This essential guide begins with the fundamentals of wine in easy-to-absorb hits of information and pragmatic, everyday tips\u2014key varietals and winemaking regions, how to taste, when to save and when to splurge, and how to set up a wine tasting at home. Aldo then teaches you how to take your wine knowledge to the next level and evolve your palate, including techniques on building a\u00a0\u201cflavor library,\u201d\u00a0a cheat sheet to good (and great) vintages (and why you shouldn\u0027t put everything on the line for them), tips on troubleshooting tricky wines (corked? mousy?), and, for the daring, even how to saber a bottle of champagne.

When it comes to improbable innovations, a legendary tech VC told Sebastian Mallaby, the future cannot be predicted, it can only be discovered. It is the nature of the venture-capital game that most attempts at discovery fail, but a very few succeed at such a scale that they more than make up for everything else. That extreme ratio of success and failure is the power law that drives the VC business, all of Silicon Valley, the wider tech sector, and, by extension, the world.\u00a0\u00a0 In The Power Law, Sebastian Mallaby has parlayed unprecedented access to the most celebrated venture capitalists of all time\u2014the key figures at Sequoia, Kleiner Perkins, Accel, Benchmark, and Andreessen Horowitz, as well as Chinese partnerships such as Qiming and Capital Today\u2014into a riveting blend of storytelling and analysis that unfurls the history of tech incubation, in the Valley and ultimately worldwide. We learn the unvarnished truth, often for the first time, about some of the most iconic triumphs and infamous disasters in Valley history, from the comedy of errors at the birth of Apple to the avalanche of venture money that fostered hubris at WeWork and Uber.\u00a0 VCs\u2019 relentless search for grand slams brews an obsession with the ideal of the lone entrepreneur-genius, and companies seen as potential \u201cunicorns\u201d are given intoxicating amounts of power, with sometimes disastrous results. On a more systemic level, the need to make outsized bets on unproven talent reinforces bias, with women and minorities still represented at woefully low levels.

An acronym for \"Phenethylamines I Have Known and Loved\", the book spans autobiography, organic chemistry, politics, ethnobotany, and psychopharmacology, and the cultural impact is likely to be profound for decades to come, as it has already.

This first half of the book is The Love Story, about two people named Shura and Alice who fall in love, though one of them is already in love with someone else. This love triangle is a painful ordeal they must go through, and that process unfolds before the reader with grace and great insight into human nature. Shura is a brilliant chemist who has dedicated his career to making psychoactive drugs, in the story they go through many experiences with the psychedelic compounds that Shura has discovered and has made in his lab, all of which have been bioassayed himself. The reader will find themselves going on this journey with them, experiencing what they experienced, both in their hearts and in the psychedelic journeys they have. The second half of PiHKAL is called The Chemical Story, and it contains detailed instructions for, and effects of, the synthesis of 179 psychedelic phenethylamines which were mostly discovered by Shulgin himself. For each substance there is information on its synthesis, suggested effective dosage, duration, and detailed commentary on the subjective effects that were experienced.

These models have obtained state-of-the-art results on datasets and tasks where large training sets are available. However, they do not transfer well to new applications with no training data, and are outperformed by unsupervised term-frequency methods such as BM25. In this work, we explore the limits of contrastive learning as a way to train unsupervised dense retrievers and show that it leads to strong performance in various retrieval settings. On the BEIR benchmark our unsupervised model outperforms BM25 on 11 out of 15 datasets for the Recall@100. When used as pre-training before fine-tuning, either on a few thousands in-domain examples or on the large MS~MARCO dataset, our contrastive model leads to improvements on the BEIR benchmark. Finally, we evaluate our approach for multi-lingual retrieval, where training data is even scarcer than for English, and show that our approach leads to strong unsupervised performance. Our model also exhibits strong cross-lingual transfer when fine-tuned on supervised English data only and evaluated on low resources language such as Swahili. We show that our unsupervised models can perform cross-lingual retrieval between different scripts, such as retrieving English documents from Arabic queries, which would not be possible with term matching methods.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e", "custom_clean": 1, "custom_lists": [{"id": 3, "sort": "Machine Learning.Deep Learning", "value": "Machine Learning.Deep Learning"}], "custom_lists_ids": "3", "custom_read_date": null, "custom_reading_list": 1, "custom_types": "Paper", "flags": 1, "has_cover": 1, "id": 247, "identifier_ids": "927", "identifiers": [{"book": 247, "id": 927, "name": "arXiv", "path": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.09118", "sort": "arxiv", "type": "arxiv", "val": "2112.09118"}], "isbn": null, "language_ids": "1", "languages": [{"avg_rating": 8.429245283018869, "count": 341, "id": 1, "name": "ENG", "sort": "ENG"}], "last_modified": "2023-03-16 22:08:36.421370+00:00", "order_by": "2022-12-05 19:21:52.360004+00:00", "path": "Gautier Izacard/Unsupervised Dense Information Retr (247)", "pubdate": "2022-12-05", "publisher_ids": "125", "publishers": [{"avg_rating": null, "count": 9, "id": 125, "name": "arXiv", "sort": "arXiv"}], "rating": null, "series": [], "series_ids": null, "size": 686136, "tag_ids": "186,189,191,237", "tags": [{"avg_rating": 7.857142857142857, "count": 28, "id": 191, "name": "Computer Science", "sort": 28}, {"avg_rating": null, "count": 11, "id": 189, "name": "Deep Learning", "sort": 11}, {"avg_rating": null, "count": 10, "id": 186, "name": "Machine Learning", "sort": 10}, {"avg_rating": null, "count": 1, "id": 237, "name": "Information Retrieval", "sort": 1}], "timestamp": "2022-12-05 19:21:52.360004+00:00", "title": "Unsupervised Dense Information Retrieval with Contrastive Learning"}, {"author_ids": "301,320,321,322,323", "authors": [{"avg_rating": null, "count": 1, "id": 320, "name": "Eric Breck", "sort": "Breck, Eric"}, {"avg_rating": null, "count": 1, "id": 321, "name": "Shanqing Cai", "sort": "Cai, Shanqing"}, {"avg_rating": null, "count": 1, "id": 322, "name": "Eric Nielsen", "sort": "Nielsen, Eric"}, {"avg_rating": null, "count": 1, "id": 323, "name": "Michael Salib", "sort": "Salib, Michael"}, {"avg_rating": null, "count": 2, "id": 301, "name": "D.

Testing and monitoring are key considerations for ensuring the production-readiness of an ML system, and for reducing technical debt of ML systems. But it can be difficult to formulate specific tests, given that the actual prediction behavior of any given model is difficult to specify a priori. In this paper, we present 28 specific tests and monitoring needs, drawn from experience with a wide range of production ML systems to help quantify these issues and present an easy to follow road-map to improve production readiness and pay down ML technical debt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAvailable at: https://research.google/pubs/pub46555/\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e", "custom_clean": 1, "custom_lists": [{"id": 3, "sort": "Machine Learning.Deep Learning", "value": "Machine Learning.Deep Learning"}], "custom_lists_ids": "3", "custom_read_date": "2022-10-27", "custom_reading_list": 0, "custom_types": "Paper", "flags": 1, "has_cover": 1, "id": 246, "identifier_ids": null, "identifiers": [], "isbn": null, "language_ids": "1", "languages": [{"avg_rating": 8.429245283018869, "count": 341, "id": 1, "name": "ENG", "sort": "ENG"}], "last_modified": "2023-07-21 18:01:20.087752+00:00", "order_by": "2022-10-27 09:23:10.337237+00:00", "path": "Eric Breck/A Rubric for ML Production Readines (246)", "pubdate": "2017-01-05", "publisher_ids": "146", "publishers": [{"avg_rating": null, "count": 2, "id": 146, "name": "IEEE", "sort": "IEEE"}], "rating": null, "series": [], "series_ids": null, "size": 500055, "tag_ids": "186,189,191", "tags": [{"avg_rating": 7.857142857142857, "count": 28, "id": 191, "name": "Computer Science", "sort": 28}, {"avg_rating": null, "count": 11, "id": 189, "name": "Deep Learning", "sort": 11}, {"avg_rating": null, "count": 10, "id": 186, "name": "Machine Learning", "sort": 10}], "timestamp": "2022-10-27 09:23:10.337237+00:00", "title": "A Rubric for ML Production Readiness and Technical Debt Reduction"}, {"author_ids": "314,315,316,317,318,319", "authors": [{"avg_rating": null, "count": 1, "id": 314, "name": "Saleema Amershi", "sort": "Amershi, Saleema"}, {"avg_rating": null, "count": 1, "id": 315, "name": "Andrew Begel", "sort": "Begel, Andrew"}, {"avg_rating": null, "count": 1, "id": 316, "name": "Christian Bird", "sort": "Bird, Christian"}, {"avg_rating": null, "count": 1, "id": 317, "name": "Robert DeLine", "sort": "DeLine, Robert"}, {"avg_rating": null, "count": 1, "id": 318, "name": "Harald Gall", "sort": "Gall, Harald"}, {"avg_rating": null, "count": 1, "id": 319, "name": "Ece Kamar", "sort": "Kamar, Ece"}], "comments": "\u003cdiv\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRecent advances in machine learning have stimulated widespread interest within the Information Technology sector on integrating AI capabilities into software and services. This goal has forced organizations to evolve their development processes. We report on a study that we conducted on observing software teams at Microsoft as they develop AI-based applications. We consider a nine-stage workflow process informed by prior experiences developing AI applications (e.g., search and NLP) and data science tools (e.g. application diagnostics and bug reporting). We found that various Microsoft teams have united this workflow into preexisting, well-evolved, Agile-like software engineering processes, providing insights about several essential engineering challenges that organizations may face in creating large-scale AI solutions for the marketplace. We collected some best practices from Microsoft teams to address these challenges. In addition, we have identified three aspects of the AI domain that make it fundamentally different from prior software application domains: 1) discovering, managing, and versioning the data needed for machine learning applications is much more complex and difficult than other types of software engineering, 2) model customization and model reuse require very different skills than are typically found in software teams, and 3) AI components are more difficult to handle as distinct modules than traditional software components - models may be \"entangled\" in complex ways and experience non-monotonic error behavior.

Our intuition is simple: learn what the world looks like and how it is described from paired text-image data, and learn how the world moves from unsupervised video footage. Make-A-Video has three advantages: (1) it accelerates training of the T2V model (it does not need to learn visual and multimodal representations from scratch), (2) it does not require paired text-video data, and (3) the generated videos inherit the vastness (diversity in aesthetic, fantastical depictions, etc.) of today\u0027s image generation models. We design a simple yet effective way to build on T2I models with novel and effective spatial-temporal modules. First, we decompose the full temporal U-Net and attention tensors and approximate them in space and time. Second, we design a spatial temporal pipeline to generate high resolution and frame rate videos with a video decoder, interpolation model and two super resolution models that can enable various applications besides T2V. In all aspects, spatial and temporal resolution, faithfulness to text, and quality, Make-A-Video sets the new state-of-the-art in text-to-video generation, as determined by both qualitative and quantitative measures.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e", "custom_clean": 1, "custom_lists": [{"id": 3, "sort": "Machine Learning.Deep Learning", "value": "Machine Learning.Deep Learning"}], "custom_lists_ids": "3", "custom_read_date": "2022-10-06", "custom_reading_list": 0, "custom_types": "Paper", "flags": 1, "has_cover": 1, "id": 202, "identifier_ids": "726", "identifiers": [{"book": 202, "id": 726, "name": "arXiv", "path": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.14792", "sort": "arxiv", "type": "arxiv", "val": "2209.14792"}], "isbn": null, "language_ids": "1", "languages": [{"avg_rating": 8.429245283018869, "count": 341, "id": 1, "name": "ENG", "sort": "ENG"}], "last_modified": "2023-01-27 19:20:40.603931+00:00", "order_by": "2022-10-15 12:36:28+00:00", "path": "Uriel Singer/Make-A-Video_ Text-to-Video Generat (202)", "pubdate": "2022-09-29", "publisher_ids": "125", "publishers": [{"avg_rating": null, "count": 9, "id": 125, "name": "arXiv", "sort": "arXiv"}], "rating": null, "series": [], "series_ids": null, "size": 14464869, "tag_ids": "186,189,191,192", "tags": [{"avg_rating": 7.857142857142857, "count": 28, "id": 191, "name": "Computer Science", "sort": 28}, {"avg_rating": null, "count": 11, "id": 189, "name": "Deep Learning", "sort": 11}, {"avg_rating": null, "count": 10, "id": 186, "name": "Machine Learning", "sort": 10}, {"avg_rating": null, "count": 2, "id": 192, "name": "Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition", "sort": 2}], "timestamp": "2022-10-15 12:36:28+00:00", "title": "Make-A-Video: Text-to-Video Generation without Text-Video Data"}, {"author_ids": "292,293,294,295,296,297,298,299", "authors": [{"avg_rating": null, "count": 1, "id": 297, "name": "Aidan N.

We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer, based solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely. Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.8 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature.

In order to clarify the intended use cases of machine learning models and minimize their usage in contexts for which they are not well suited, we recommend that released models be accompanied by documentation detailing their performance characteristics. In this paper, we propose a framework that we call model cards, to encourage such transparent model reporting. Model cards are short documents accompanying trained machine learning models that provide benchmarked evaluation in a variety of conditions, such as across different cultural, demographic, or phenotypic groups (e.g., race, geographic location, sex, Fitzpatrick skin type) and intersectional groups (e.g., age and race, or sex and Fitzpatrick skin type) that are relevant to the intended application domains. Model cards also disclose the context in which models are intended to be used, details of the performance evaluation procedures, and other relevant information. While we focus primarily on human-centered machine learning models in the application fields of computer vision and natural language processing, this framework can be used to document any trained machine learning model. To solidify the concept, we provide cards for two supervised models: One trained to detect smiling faces in images, and one trained to detect toxic comments in text. We propose model cards as a step towards the responsible democratization of machine learning and related AI technology, increasing transparency into how well AI technology works. We hope this work encourages those releasing trained machine learning models to accompany model releases with similar detailed evaluation numbers and other relevant documentation.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e", "custom_clean": 1, "custom_lists": [{"id": 3, "sort": "Machine Learning.Deep Learning", "value": "Machine Learning.Deep Learning"}], "custom_lists_ids": "3", "custom_read_date": null, "custom_reading_list": 1, "custom_types": "Paper", "flags": 1, "has_cover": 1, "id": 239, "identifier_ids": "835", "identifiers": [{"book": 239, "id": 835, "name": "arXiv", "path": "https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.03993", "sort": "arxiv", "type": "arxiv", "val": "1810.03993"}], "isbn": null, "language_ids": "1", "languages": [{"avg_rating": 8.429245283018869, "count": 341, "id": 1, "name": "ENG", "sort": "ENG"}], "last_modified": "2023-01-27 19:20:40.603931+00:00", "order_by": "2022-10-12 20:13:38.586617+00:00", "path": "Margaret Mitchell/Model Cards for Model Reporting (239)", "pubdate": "2018-10-05", "publisher_ids": "125", "publishers": [{"avg_rating": null, "count": 9, "id": 125, "name": "arXiv", "sort": "arXiv"}], "rating": null, "series": [], "series_ids": null, "size": 995470, "tag_ids": "186,189,191", "tags": [{"avg_rating": 7.857142857142857, "count": 28, "id": 191, "name": "Computer Science", "sort": 28}, {"avg_rating": null, "count": 11, "id": 189, "name": "Deep Learning", "sort": 11}, {"avg_rating": null, "count": 10, "id": 186, "name": "Machine Learning", "sort": 10}], "timestamp": "2022-10-12 20:13:38.586617+00:00", "title": "Model Cards for Model Reporting"}, {"author_ids": "220,222,287,288,289,290", "authors": [{"avg_rating": null, "count": 1, "id": 289, "name": "Greg Brockman", "sort": "Brockman, Greg"}, {"avg_rating": null, "count": 2, "id": 220, "name": "Jong Wook Kim", "sort": "Kim, Jong Wook"}, {"avg_rating": null, "count": 1, "id": 290, "name": "Christine McLeavey", "sort": "McLeavey, Christine"}, {"avg_rating": null, "count": 1, "id": 287, "name": "Alex Radford", "sort": "Radford, Alex"}, {"avg_rating": null, "count": 2, "id": 222, "name": "Ilya Sutskever", "sort": "Sutskever, Ilya"}, {"avg_rating": null, "count": 1, "id": 288, "name": "Tao Xu", "sort": "Xu, Tao"}], "comments": "\u003cdiv\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe study the capabilities of speech processing systems trained simply to predict large amounts of transcripts of audio on the internet.

Scott Fitzgerald that follows a cast of characters living in the fictional town of West Egg on prosperous Long Island in the summer of 1922. The story primarily concerns the young and mysterious millionaire Jay Gatsby and his quixotic passion and obsession for the beautiful former debutante Daisy Buchanan. Considered to be Fitzgerald\u0027s magnum opus, The Great Gatsby explores themes of decadence, idealism, resistance to change, social upheaval, and excess, creating a portrait of the Jazz Age or the Roaring Twenties that has been described as a cautionary tale regarding the American Dream. Fitzgerald-inspired by the parties he had attended while visiting Long Island\u0027s north shore-began planning the novel in 1923, desiring to produce, in his words, \"something new-something extraordinary and beautiful and simple and intricately patterned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\" Progress was slow, with Fitzgerald completing his first draft following a move to the French Riviera in 1924. His editor, Maxwell Perkins, felt the book was vague and persuaded the author to revise over the next winter. Fitzgerald was repeatedly ambivalent about the book\u0027s title and he considered a variety of alternatives, including titles that referenced the Roman character Trimalchio; the title he was last documented to have desired was Under the Red, White, and Blue. In its first year, the book sold only 20,000 copies. Fitzgerald died in 1940, believing himself to be a failure and his work forgotten. However, the novel experienced a revival during World War II, and became a part of American high school curricula and numerous stage and film adaptations in the following decades. Today, The Great Gatsby is widely considered to be a literary classic and a contender for the title \"Great American Novel\". In 1998, the Modern Library editorial board voted it the 20th century\u0027s best American novel and second best English-language novel of the same time period.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e", "custom_clean": 1, "custom_lists": [{"id": 6, "sort": "Must Read.10 Greatest Books of All Time", "value": "Must Read.10 Greatest Books of All Time"}, {"id": 7, "sort": "Gutenberg Collection", "value": "Gutenberg Collection"}], "custom_lists_ids": "6,7", "custom_read_date": null, "custom_reading_list": 0, "custom_types": "eBook", "flags": 1, "has_cover": 1, "id": 211, "identifier_ids": "771,768,769,770", "identifiers": [{"book": 211, "id": 770, "name": "ISBN", "path": "https://www.worldcat.org/isbn/9789176371213", "sort": "isbn", "type": "isbn", "val": "9789176371213"}, {"book": 211, "id": 769, "name": "Gutenberg", "path": "http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/64317", "sort": "gutenberg", "type": "gutenberg", "val": "64317"}, {"book": 211, "id": 768, "name": "Google Books", "path": "https://books.google.com/books?id=u-OCjwEACAAJ", "sort": "google", "type": "google", "val": "u-OCjwEACAAJ"}, {"book": 211, "id": 771, "name": "Goodreads", "path": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28787401", "sort": "goodreads", "type": "goodreads", "val": "28787401"}], "isbn": "9789176371213", "language_ids": "1", "languages": [{"avg_rating": 8.429245283018869, "count": 341, "id": 1, "name": "ENG", "sort": "ENG"}], "last_modified": "2023-05-04 17:55:52.136675+00:00", "order_by": "2022-10-10 14:39:37.098030+00:00", "path": "F.

Balls and soires, the burning of Moscow, the intrigues of statesmen and generals, scenes of violent battles, the quiet moments of everyday life--all in a work whose extraordinary imaginative power has never been surpassed. The Maudes\u0027 translation of Tolstoy\u0027s epic masterpiece has long been considered the best English version, and now for the first time it has been revised to bring it fully into line with modern approaches to the text. French passages are restored, Anglicization of Russian names removed, and outmoded expressions updated. A new introduction by Amy Mandelker considers the novel\u0027s literary and historical context, the nature of the work, and Tolstoy\u0027s artistic and philosophical aims.

However, these models lack the ability to mimic the appearance of subjects in a given reference set and synthesize novel renditions of them in different contexts. In this work, we present a new approach for \"personalization\" of text-to-image diffusion models (specializing them to users\u0027 needs). Given as input just a few images of a subject, we fine-tune a pretrained text-to-image model (Imagen, although our method is not limited to a specific model) such that it learns to bind a unique identifier with that specific subject. Once the subject is embedded in the output domain of the model, the unique identifier can then be used to synthesize fully-novel photorealistic images of the subject contextualized in different scenes. By leveraging the semantic prior embedded in the model with a new autogenous class-specific prior preservation loss, our technique enables synthesizing the subject in diverse scenes, poses, views, and lighting conditions that do not appear in the reference images. We apply our technique to several previously-unassailable tasks, including subject recontextualization, text-guided view synthesis, appearance modification, and artistic rendering (all while preserving the subject\u0027s key features).\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e", "custom_clean": 1, "custom_lists": [{"id": 3, "sort": "Machine Learning.Deep Learning", "value": "Machine Learning.Deep Learning"}], "custom_lists_ids": "3", "custom_read_date": "2022-08-17", "custom_reading_list": 0, "custom_types": "Paper", "flags": 1, "has_cover": 1, "id": 201, "identifier_ids": "724", "identifiers": [{"book": 201, "id": 724, "name": "arXiv", "path": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.12242", "sort": "arxiv", "type": "arxiv", "val": "2208.12242"}], "isbn": null, "language_ids": "1", "languages": [{"avg_rating": 8.429245283018869, "count": 341, "id": 1, "name": "ENG", "sort": "ENG"}], "last_modified": "2022-10-19 08:42:27.829507+00:00", "order_by": "2022-10-10 10:33:15+00:00", "path": "Nataniel Ruiz/DreamBooth Fine Tuning T2I Diffusio (201)", "pubdate": "2022-08-25", "publisher_ids": "125", "publishers": [{"avg_rating": null, "count": 9, "id": 125, "name": "arXiv", "sort": "arXiv"}], "rating": null, "series": [], "series_ids": null, "size": 17258364, "tag_ids": "188,189,191,192", "tags": [{"avg_rating": 7.857142857142857, "count": 28, "id": 191, "name": "Computer Science", "sort": 28}, {"avg_rating": null, "count": 11, "id": 189, "name": "Deep Learning", "sort": 11}, {"avg_rating": null, "count": 2, "id": 188, "name": "Paper", "sort": 2}, {"avg_rating": null, "count": 2, "id": 192, "name": "Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition", "sort": 2}], "timestamp": "2022-10-10 10:33:15+00:00", "title": "DreamBooth Fine Tuning T2I Diffusion Models for Subject Driven Generation"}, {"author_ids": "262", "authors": [{"avg_rating": 6.0, "count": 1, "id": 262, "name": "Lazy Programmer", "sort": "Programmer, Lazy"}], "comments": "\u003cdiv\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDeep learning is making waves.

Instead, we will let the neural network learn these things for us. Each layer of the neural network learns a different abstraction than the previous layers. For example, in image classification, the first layer might learn different strokes, and in the next layer put the strokes together to learn shapes, and in the next layer put the shapes together to form facial features, and in the next layer have a high level representation of faces.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn top of all this, deep learning is known for winning its fair share Kaggle contests.

Though marred by hints of unexamined anti-Semitism, Orwell\u0027s debut remains, as The Nation put it, \"the most lucid portrait of poverty in the English language.\" --Tim Appelo\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e", "custom_clean": 1, "custom_lists": [], "custom_lists_ids": null, "custom_read_date": null, "custom_reading_list": 0, "custom_types": "eBook", "flags": 1, "has_cover": 1, "id": 159, "identifier_ids": "483,484,481,482", "identifiers": [{"book": 159, "id": 482, "name": "ISBN", "path": "https://www.worldcat.org/isbn/9780156262248", "sort": "isbn", "type": "isbn", "val": "9780156262248"}, {"book": 159, "id": 481, "name": "Google Books", "path": "https://books.google.com/books?id=m5vIVN7LjtgC", "sort": "google", "type": "google", "val": "m5vIVN7LjtgC"}, {"book": 159, "id": 484, "name": "Goodreads", "path": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34304872", "sort": "goodreads", "type": "goodreads", "val": "34304872"}, {"book": 159, "id": 483, "name": "Amazon", "path": "https://amazon.com/dp/015626224X", "sort": "amazon", "type": "amazon", "val": "015626224X"}], "isbn": "9780156262248", "language_ids": "1", "languages": [{"avg_rating": 8.429245283018869, "count": 341, "id": 1, "name": "ENG", "sort": "ENG"}], "last_modified": "2023-05-04 17:55:52.136675+00:00", "order_by": "2022-10-06 09:35:53.313990+00:00", "path": "George Orwell/Down and Out in Paris and London (159)", "pubdate": "1933-01-01", "publisher_ids": "90", "publishers": [{"avg_rating": 8.8, "count": 20, "id": 90, "name": "Penguin Random House", "sort": "Penguin Random House"}], "rating": 4, "series": [], "series_ids": null, "size": 690052, "tag_ids": "57,60,90,92,153", "tags": [{"avg_rating": 8.222222222222221, "count": 31, "id": 92, "name": "Biography", "sort": 31}, {"avg_rating": 8.578947368421053, "count": 28, "id": 153, "name": "Classics", "sort": 28}, {"avg_rating": 8.363636363636363, "count": 24, "id": 60, "name": "History", "sort": 24}, {"avg_rating": 8.347826086956522, "count": 23, "id": 57, "name": "Politics", "sort": 23}, {"avg_rating": 7.5, "count": 4, "id": 90, "name": "Travel", "sort": 4}], "timestamp": "2022-10-06 09:35:53.313990+00:00", "title": "Down and Out in Paris and London"}, {"author_ids": "166", "authors": [{"avg_rating": 8.0, "count": 1, "id": 166, "name": "John Kennedy Toole", "sort": "Toole, John Kennedy"}], "comments": "\u003cdiv\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReleased by Louisiana State University Press in 1980, A Confederacy of Dunces is nothing short of a publishing phenomenon. Rejected by countless publishers and submitted by the author\u0027s mother years after his suicide, the book won the 1981 Pulitzer Prize for Fiction. Today there are almost two million copies in print worldwide in eighteen languages. Now, for the first time, John Kennedy Toole\u0027s comic masterpiece is available in a large print edition. Toole\u0027s lunatic and sage novel introduces one of the most memorable characters in American literature, Ignatius Reilly, whom Walker Percy dubs \"slob extraordinaire, a mad Oliver Hardy, a fat Don Quixote, a perverse Thomas Aquinas rolled into one.\" Set in New Orleans, A Confederacy of Dunces outswifts Swift, one of whose essays gives the book its title. As its characters burst into life, they leave the region and literature forever changed by their presence -- Ignatius and his mother; Miss Trixie, the octogenarian assistant accountant at Levi Pants; inept, wan Patrolman Mancuso; Darlene, the Bourbon Street stripper with a penchant for poultry; Jones the jivecat in spaceage dark glasses.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIncluded here is the introduction that writer and New Orleans resident Andrei Codrescu composed for the book\u0027s twentieth anniversary.

No one in her family, in either the United States or Colombia, spoke of infectious diseases, and even into her thirties, she only knew that her aunt had died of a rare illness called Chagas.

She learns that outside of Latin America, the United States is the only country with the native insects\u2014the \"kissing bugs\"\u2014that carry the Chagas parasite. She spends a night in southwest Texas hunting the dreaded bug with university researchers. She also gets to know patients, like a mother whose premature baby was born infected with the parasite, his heart already damaged.

Sullivan, Jr., Washington Post From one of our top historians, a groundbreaking story of policing and \u201criots\u201d that shatters our understanding of the post\u2013civil rights era. What began in spring 2020 as local protests in response to the killing of George Floyd by Minneapolis police quickly exploded into a massive nationwide movement. Millions of mostly young people defiantly flooded into the nation\u2019s streets, demanding an end to police brutality and to the broader, systemic repression of Black people and other people of color. To many observers, the protests appeared to be without precedent in their scale and persistence. Yet, as the acclaimed historian Elizabeth Hinton demonstrates in America on Fire, the events of 2020 had clear precursors\u2014and any attempt to understand our current crisis requires a reckoning with the recent past. Even in the aftermath of Donald Trump, many Americans consider the decades since the civil rights movement in the mid-1960s as a story of progress toward greater inclusiveness and equality. Hinton\u2019s sweeping narrative uncovers an altogether different history, taking us on a troubling journey from Detroit in 1967 and Miami in 1980 to Los Angeles in 1992 and beyond to chart the persistence of structural racism and one of its primary consequences, the so-called urban riot. Hinton offers a critical corrective: the word riot was nothing less than a racist trope applied to events that can only be properly understood as rebellions\u2014explosions of collective resistance to an unequal and violent order. As she suggests, if rebellion and the conditions that precipitated it never disappeared, the optimistic story of a post\u2013Jim Crow United States no longer holds. Black rebellion, America on Fire powerfully illustrates, was born in response to poverty and exclusion, but most immediately in reaction to police violence. In 1968, President Lyndon Johnson launched the \u201cWar on Crime,\u201d sending militarized police forces into impoverished Black neighborhoods. Facing increasing surveillance and brutality, residents threw rocks and Molotov cocktails at officers, plundered local businesses, and vandalized exploitative institutions. Hinton draws on exclusive sources to uncover a previously hidden geography of violence in smaller American cities, from York, Pennsylvania, to Cairo, Illinois, to Stockton, California. The central lesson from these eruptions\u2014that police violence invariably leads to community violence\u2014continues to escape policymakers, who respond by further criminalizing entire groups instead of addressing underlying socioeconomic causes. The results are the hugely expanded policing and prison regimes that shape the lives of so many Americans today. Presenting a new framework for understanding our nation\u2019s enduring strife, America on Fire is also a warning: rebellions will surely continue unless police are no longer called on to manage the consequences of dismal conditions beyond their control, and until an oppressive system is finally remade on the principles of justice and equality.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e", "custom_clean": 1, "custom_lists": [{"id": 5, "sort": "Must Read.2021 Time", "value": "Must Read.2021 Time"}], "custom_lists_ids": "5", "custom_read_date": null, "custom_reading_list": 0, "custom_types": "eBook", "flags": 1, "has_cover": 1, "id": 144, "identifier_ids": "351,352,353", "identifiers": [{"book": 144, "id": 353, "name": "ISBN", "path": "https://www.worldcat.org/isbn/9781631498916", "sort": "isbn", "type": "isbn", "val": "9781631498916"}, {"book": 144, "id": 352, "name": "Google Books", "path": "https://books.google.com/books?id=PAwDEAAAQBAJ", "sort": "google", "type": "google", "val": "PAwDEAAAQBAJ"}, {"book": 144, "id": 351, "name": "Goodreads", "path": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/55298326", "sort": "goodreads", "type": "goodreads", "val": "55298326"}], "isbn": "9781631498916", "language_ids": "1", "languages": [{"avg_rating": 8.429245283018869, "count": 341, "id": 1, "name": "ENG", "sort": "ENG"}], "last_modified": "2023-05-04 17:55:52.136675+00:00", "order_by": "2022-10-05 15:54:15.142378+00:00", "path": "Elizabeth Hinton/America on Fire_ The Untold History (144)", "pubdate": "2021-05-18", "publisher_ids": "84", "publishers": [{"avg_rating": 8.0, "count": 4, "id": 84, "name": "Liveright Publishing", "sort": "Liveright Publishing"}], "rating": 4, "series": [], "series_ids": null, "size": 12900649, "tag_ids": "57,60,194", "tags": [{"avg_rating": 8.333333333333334, "count": 40, "id": 194, "name": "Time", "sort": 40}, {"avg_rating": 8.363636363636363, "count": 24, "id": 60, "name": "History", "sort": 24}, {"avg_rating": 8.347826086956522, "count": 23, "id": 57, "name": "Politics", "sort": 23}], "timestamp": "2022-10-05 15:54:15.142378+00:00", "title": "America on Fire: The Untold History of Police Violence and Black Rebellion Since the 1960s"}, {"author_ids": "145", "authors": [{"avg_rating": 8.0, "count": 1, "id": 145, "name": "Elizabeth Kolbert", "sort": "Kolbert, Elizabeth"}], "comments": "\u003cdiv\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNATIONAL BESTSELLER * The Pulitzer Prize-winning author of The Sixth Extinction returns to humanity\u0027s transformative impact on the environment, now asking: After doing so much damage, can we change nature, this time to save it?

So pervasive are human impacts on the planet that it\u0027s said we live in a new geological epoch: the Anthropocene. In Under a White Sky, Elizabeth Kolbert takes a hard look at the new world we are creating. Along the way, she meets biologists who are trying to preserve the world\u0027s rarest fish, which lives in a single tiny pool in the middle of the Mojave; engineers who are turning carbon emissions to stone in Iceland; Australian researchers who are trying to develop a \"super coral\" that can survive on a hotter globe; and physicists who are contemplating shooting tiny diamonds into the stratosphere to cool the earth. One way to look at human civilization, says Kolbert, is as a ten-thousand-year exercise in defying nature. In The Sixth Extinction, she explored the ways in which our capacity for destruction has reshaped the natural world. Now she examines how the very sorts of interventions that have imperiled our planet are increasingly seen as the only hope for its salvation. By turns inspiring, terrifying, and darkly comic, Under a White Sky is an utterly original examination of the challenges we face.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e", "custom_clean": 1, "custom_lists": [{"id": 5, "sort": "Must Read.2021 Time", "value": "Must Read.2021 Time"}], "custom_lists_ids": "5", "custom_read_date": null, "custom_reading_list": 0, "custom_types": "eBook", "flags": 1, "has_cover": 1, "id": 143, "identifier_ids": "462,461,460,459", "identifiers": [{"book": 143, "id": 459, "name": "ISBN", "path": "https://www.worldcat.org/isbn/9780593136287", "sort": "isbn", "type": "isbn", "val": "9780593136287"}, {"book": 143, "id": 460, "name": "Google Books", "path": "https://books.google.com/books?id=qwpjEAAAQBAJ", "sort": "google", "type": "google", "val": "qwpjEAAAQBAJ"}, {"book": 143, "id": 461, "name": "Goodreads", "path": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/60757903", "sort": "goodreads", "type": "goodreads", "val": "60757903"}, {"book": 143, "id": 462, "name": "Amazon", "path": "https://amazon.com/dp/B08DMWR6BP", "sort": "amazon", "type": "amazon", "val": "B08DMWR6BP"}], "isbn": "9780593136287", "language_ids": "1", "languages": [{"avg_rating": 8.429245283018869, "count": 341, "id": 1, "name": "ENG", "sort": "ENG"}], "last_modified": "2023-05-04 17:55:52.136675+00:00", "order_by": "2022-10-05 15:54:14.761371+00:00", "path": "Elizabeth Kolbert/Under a White Sky_ The Nature of th (143)", "pubdate": "2021-02-09", "publisher_ids": "100", "publishers": [{"avg_rating": 8.0, "count": 6, "id": 100, "name": "Crown Publishing Group", "sort": "Crown Publishing Group"}], "rating": 4, "series": [], "series_ids": null, "size": 4317039, "tag_ids": "57,58,60,125,194,253", "tags": [{"avg_rating": 8.333333333333334, "count": 40, "id": 194, "name": "Time", "sort": 40}, {"avg_rating": 8.363636363636363, "count": 24, "id": 60, "name": "History", "sort": 24}, {"avg_rating": 8.347826086956522, "count": 23, "id": 57, "name": "Politics", "sort": 23}, {"avg_rating": 8.222222222222221, "count": 11, "id": 58, "name": "Science", "sort": 11}, {"avg_rating": 8.0, "count": 2, "id": 253, "name": "Non-Fiction", "sort": 2}, {"avg_rating": 8.0, "count": 1, "id": 125, "name": "Climate Crisis", "sort": 1}], "timestamp": "2022-10-05 15:54:14.761371+00:00", "title": "Under a White Sky: The Nature of the Future"}, {"author_ids": "144", "authors": [{"avg_rating": 8.0, "count": 1, "id": 144, "name": "Gabriel Krauze", "sort": "Krauze, Gabriel"}], "comments": "\u003cdiv\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLonglisted for the Booker Prize 2020 A Spectator Book of the Year \u0027A literary rendering of the Top Boy generation...

Nobody, including the lawmakers who passed the bill, expected it to transform the country\u2019s demographics. But over the next four decades, millions arrived, including Jay Caspian Kang\u2019s parents, grandparents, aunts, and uncles. They came with almost no understanding of their new home, much less the history of \u201cAsian America\u201d that was supposed to define them.\u00a0The Loneliest Americans is the unforgettable story of Kang and his family as they move from a housing project in Cambridge to an idyllic college town in the South and eventually to the West Coast.

Pop Song is a book about love and about falling in love\u2014with a place, or a painting, or a person\u2014and the joy and terror inherent in the experience of that love. Plumbing the well of culture for clues and patterns about love and loss\u2014from Agnes Martin\u0027s abstract paintings to James Turrell\u0027s transcendent light works, and Anne Carson\u0027s Eros the Bittersweet to Frank Ocean\u0027s Blonde\u2014Pham writes of her youthful attempts to find meaning in travel, sex, drugs, and art, before sensing that she might need to turn her gaze upon herself. Pop Song is also a book about distances, near and far. As she travels from Taos, New Mexico, to Shanghai, China and beyond, Pham meditates on the miles we are willing to cover to get away from ourselves, or those who hurt us, and the impossible gaps that can exist between two people sharing a bed. Pop Song is a book about all the routes by which we might escape our own needs before finally finding a way home. There is heartache in these pages, but Pham\u0027s electric ways of seeing create a perfectly fractured portrait of modern intimacy that is triumphant in both its vulnerability and restlessness. \"Each of the essays in this debut collection reads like a mini-memoir ... in which the author reflects on her experiences of young love, trauma, and transcendence through discussions of art and music ... with an intimacy that is at once tender and expansive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\" \u2014New York magazine\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e", "custom_clean": 1, "custom_lists": [{"id": 5, "sort": "Must Read.2021 Time", "value": "Must Read.2021 Time"}], "custom_lists_ids": "5", "custom_read_date": null, "custom_reading_list": 0, "custom_types": "eBook", "flags": 1, "has_cover": 1, "id": 133, "identifier_ids": "320,318,319", "identifiers": [{"book": 133, "id": 319, "name": "ISBN", "path": "https://www.worldcat.org/isbn/9781646220274", "sort": "isbn", "type": "isbn", "val": "9781646220274"}, {"book": 133, "id": 318, "name": "Google Books", "path": "https://books.google.com/books?id=V6UQEAAAQBAJ", "sort": "google", "type": "google", "val": "V6UQEAAAQBAJ"}, {"book": 133, "id": 320, "name": "Goodreads", "path": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/60057391", "sort": "goodreads", "type": "goodreads", "val": "60057391"}], "isbn": "9781646220274", "language_ids": "1", "languages": [{"avg_rating": 8.429245283018869, "count": 341, "id": 1, "name": "ENG", "sort": "ENG"}], "last_modified": "2023-05-04 17:55:52.136675+00:00", "order_by": "2022-10-05 15:54:11.131714+00:00", "path": "Larissa Pham/Pop Song_ Adventures in Art \u0026 Intim (133)", "pubdate": "2021-05-04", "publisher_ids": "77", "publishers": [{"avg_rating": 8.0, "count": 1, "id": 77, "name": "Catapult", "sort": "Catapult"}], "rating": 4, "series": [], "series_ids": null, "size": 1035488, "tag_ids": "44,49,92,132,133,194", "tags": [{"avg_rating": 8.89655172413793, "count": 51, "id": 49, "name": "Contemporary", "sort": 51}, {"avg_rating": 8.333333333333334, "count": 40, "id": 194, "name": "Time", "sort": 40}, {"avg_rating": 8.222222222222221, "count": 31, "id": 92, "name": "Biography", "sort": 31}, {"avg_rating": 8.0, "count": 6, "id": 44, "name": "Art", "sort": 6}, {"avg_rating": 7.6, "count": 6, "id": 132, "name": "Music", "sort": 6}, {"avg_rating": 8.333333333333334, "count": 6, "id": 133, "name": "Feminism", "sort": 6}], "timestamp": "2022-10-05 15:54:11.131714+00:00", "title": "Pop Song: Adventures in Art \u0026 Intimacy"}, {"author_ids": "134", "authors": [{"avg_rating": 8.0, "count": 1, "id": 134, "name": "Louis Menand", "sort": "Menand, Louis"}], "comments": "\u003cdiv\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"An engrossing and impossibly wide-ranging project ...

It was also about ideas, in the broadest sense\u2014economic and political, artistic and personal. In The Free World, the acclaimed Pulitzer Prize\u2013winning scholar and critic Louis Menand tells the story of American culture in the pivotal years from the end of World War II to Vietnam and shows how changing economic, technological, and social forces put their mark on creations of the mind. How did elitism and an anti-totalitarian skepticism of passion and ideology give way to a new sensibility defined by freewheeling experimentation and loving the Beatles? How was the ideal of \u201cfreedom\u201d applied to causes that ranged from anti-communism and civil rights to radical acts of self-creation via art and even crime? With the wit and insight familiar to readers of The Metaphysical Club and his New Yorker essays, Menand takes us inside Hannah Arendt\u2019s Manhattan, the Paris of Jean-Paul Sartre and Simone de Beauvoir, Merce Cunningham and John Cage\u2019s residencies at North Carolina\u2019s Black Mountain College, and the Memphis studio where Sam Phillips and Elvis Presley created a new music for the American teenager. He examines the post war vogue for French existentialism, structuralism and post-structuralism, the rise of abstract expressionism and pop art, Allen Ginsberg\u2019s friendship with Lionel Trilling, James Baldwin\u2019s transformation into a Civil Right spokesman, Susan Sontag\u2019s challenges to the New York Intellectuals, the defeat of obscenity laws, and the rise of the New Hollywood. Stressing the rich flow of ideas across the Atlantic, he also shows how Europeans played a vital role in promoting and influencing American art and entertainment. By the end of the Vietnam era, the American government had lost the moral prestige it enjoyed at the end of the Second World War, but America\u2019s once-despised culture had become respected and adored.

Next he directed four consecutive hit plays, won back-to-back Tonys, ushered in a new era of Hollywood moviemaking with Who\u0027s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?, and followed it with The Graduate, which won him an Oscar and became the third-highest-grossing movie ever.

It would take decades for him to come to grips with his demons. In an incomparable portrait that follows Nichols from Berlin to New York to Chicago to Hollywood, Mark Harris explores, with brilliantly vivid detail and insight, the life, work, struggle, and passion of an artist and man in constant motion. Among the 250 people Harris interviewed: Elaine May, Meryl Streep, Stephen Sondheim, Robert Redford, Glenn Close, Tom Hanks, Candice Bergen, Emma Thompson, Annette Bening, Natalie Portman, Julia Roberts, Lorne Michaels, and Gloria Steinem.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMark Harris gives an intimate and evenhanded accounting of success and failure alike; the portrait is not always flattering, but its ultimate impact is to present the full story of one of the most richly interesting, complicated, and consequential figures the worlds of theater and motion pictures have ever seen.

With these and other ruptures, Nadia arrived in New York as a young woman feeling stateless, motherless, and uncertain about her future, yet eager to find her own identity. What followed, however, were periods of depression in which she struggled to hold herself and her siblings together. \u201cA magnificent, complex assessment of selfhood and why it matters\u201d (Elle), Aftershocks depicts the way she hauled herself from the wreckage of her life\u2019s perpetual quaking, the means by which she has finally come to understand that the only ground firm enough to count on is the one written into existence by her own hand. \u201cFull of narrative risk and untrammeled lyricism\u201d (The Washington Post), Aftershocks joins the likes of Don\u2019t Let\u2019s Go to the Dogs Tonight and William Styron\u2019s Darkness Visible, and does for race identity what Maggie Nelson does for gender identity in The Argonauts.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e", "custom_clean": 1, "custom_lists": [{"id": 5, "sort": "Must Read.2021 Time", "value": "Must Read.2021 Time"}], "custom_lists_ids": "5", "custom_read_date": null, "custom_reading_list": 0, "custom_types": "eBook", "flags": 1, "has_cover": 1, "id": 127, "identifier_ids": "415,416", "identifiers": [{"book": 127, "id": 416, "name": "ISBN", "path": "https://www.worldcat.org/isbn/9781982111236", "sort": "isbn", "type": "isbn", "val": "9781982111236"}, {"book": 127, "id": 415, "name": "Google Books", "path": "https://books.google.com/books?id=VBQ3EAAAQBAJ", "sort": "google", "type": "google", "val": "VBQ3EAAAQBAJ"}], "isbn": "9781982111236", "language_ids": "1", "languages": [{"avg_rating": 8.429245283018869, "count": 341, "id": 1, "name": "ENG", "sort": "ENG"}], "last_modified": "2023-05-04 17:55:52.136675+00:00", "order_by": "2022-10-05 15:54:08.709178+00:00", "path": "Nadia Owusu/Aftershocks_ A Memoir (127)", "pubdate": "2021-08-03", "publisher_ids": "22", "publishers": [{"avg_rating": 8.0, "count": 8, "id": 22, "name": "Simon \u0026 Schuster", "sort": "Simon \u0026 Schuster"}], "rating": null, "series": [], "series_ids": null, "size": 3951047, "tag_ids": "92,119,120,150,194,331", "tags": [{"avg_rating": 8.333333333333334, "count": 40, "id": 194, "name": "Time", "sort": 40}, {"avg_rating": 8.222222222222221, "count": 31, "id": 92, "name": "Biography", "sort": 31}, {"avg_rating": 10.0, "count": 5, "id": 331, "name": "Girls \u0026 Women", "sort": 5}, {"avg_rating": 10.0, "count": 2, "id": 119, "name": "Ethnic \u0026 Regional", "sort": 2}, {"avg_rating": 10.0, "count": 2, "id": 120, "name": "African American \u0026 Black", "sort": 2}, {"avg_rating": null, "count": 1, "id": 150, "name": "Cultural", "sort": 1}], "timestamp": "2022-10-05 15:54:08.709178+00:00", "title": "Aftershocks: A Memoir"}, {"author_ids": "128", "authors": [{"avg_rating": 8.0, "count": 1, "id": 128, "name": "Nicole Eustace", "sort": "Eustace, Nicole"}], "comments": "\u003cdiv\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the eve of a major treaty conference between Iroquois leaders and European colonists in the distant summer of 1722, two white fur traders attacked an Indigenous hunter and left him for dead near Conestoga, Pennsylvania. Though virtually forgotten today, this act of brutality set into motion a remarkable series of criminal investigations and cross-cultural negotiations that challenged the definition of justice in early America.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn Covered with Night , leading historian Nicole Eustace reconstructs the crime and its aftermath, bringing us into the overlapping worlds of white colonists and Indigenous peoples in this formative period. As she shows, the murder of the Indigenous man set the entire mid-Atlantic on edge, with many believing war was imminent. Isolated killings often flared into colonial wars in North America, and colonists now anticipated a vengeful Indigenous uprising. Frantic efforts to resolve the case ignited a dramatic, far-reaching debate between Native American forms of justice\u2014centered on community, forgiveness, and reparations\u2014and an ideology of harsh reprisal, unique to the colonies and based on British law, which called for the killers\u2019 swift execution.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn charting the far-reaching ramifications of the murder, Covered with Night \u2014a phrase from Iroquois mourning practices\u2014overturns persistent assumptions about \u201ccivilized\u201d Europeans and \u201csavage\u201d Native Americans. As Eustace powerfully contends, the colonial obsession with \u201ccivility\u201d belied the reality that the Iroquois, far from being the barbarians of the white imagination, acted under a mantle of sophistication and humanity as they tried to make the land- and power-hungry colonials understand their ways. In truth, Eustace reveals, the Iroquois\u2014the Six Nations of the Haudenosaunee, as they are known today\u2014saw the killing as an opportunity to forge stronger bonds with the colonists. They argued for restorative justice and for reconciliation between the two sides, even as they mourned the deceased.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn absorbing chronicle built around an extraordinary group of characters\u2014from the slain man\u2019s resilient widow to the Indigenous diplomat known as \u201cCaptain Civility\u201d to the scheming governor of Pennsylvania\u2014 Covered with Night transforms a single event into an unforgettable portrait of early America.

From the prize-winning and bestselling author of Say Nothing The history of the Sackler dynasty is rife with drama\u2014baroque personal lives; bitter disputes over estates; fistfights in boardrooms; glittering art collections; Machiavellian courtroom maneuvers; and the calculated use of money to burnish reputations and crush the less powerful.\u00a0The Sackler name has adorned the walls of many storied institutions\u2014Harvard, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Oxford, the Louvre. They are one of the richest families in the world, known for their lavish donations to the arts and the sciences. The source of the family fortune was vague, however, until it emerged that the Sacklers were responsible for making and marketing a blockbuster painkiller that was the catalyst for the opioid crisis. Empire of Pain begins with the story of three doctor brothers, Raymond, Mortimer and the incalculably energetic Arthur, who weathered the poverty of the Great Depression and appalling anti-Semitism. Working at a barbaric mental institution, Arthur saw a better way and conducted groundbreaking research into drug treatments. He also had a genius for marketing, especially for pharmaceuticals, and bought a small ad firm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eArthur devised the marketing for Valium, and built the first great Sackler fortune. He purchased a drug manufacturer, Purdue Frederick, which would be run by Raymond and Mortimer. The brothers began collecting art, and wives, and grand residences in exotic locales. Their children and grandchildren grew up in luxury.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eForty years later, Raymond\u2019s son Richard ran the family-owned Purdue. The template Arthur Sackler created to sell Valium\u2014co-opting doctors, influencing the FDA, downplaying the drug\u2019s addictiveness\u2014was employed to launch a far more potent product: OxyContin. The drug went on to generate some thirty-five billion dollars in revenue, and to launch a public health crisis in which hundreds of thousands would die. This is the saga of three generations of a single family and the mark they would leave on the world, a tale that moves from the bustling streets of early twentieth-century Brooklyn to the seaside palaces\u00a0of Greenwich, Connecticut, and Cap d\u2019Antibes to the corridors of power in Washington, D.C.\u00a0 Empire of Pain chronicles the multiple investigations of the Sacklers and their company, and the scorched-earth legal tactics that the family has used to evade accountability.\u00a0Empire of Pain is a masterpiece of narrative reporting and writing, exhaustively documented and ferociously compelling. It is a portrait of the excesses of America\u2019s second Gilded Age, a study of impunity among the super elite and a relentless investigation of the naked greed and indifference to human suffering that built one of the world\u2019s great fortunes.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e", "custom_clean": 1, "custom_lists": [{"id": 5, "sort": "Must Read.2021 Time", "value": "Must Read.2021 Time"}], "custom_lists_ids": "5", "custom_read_date": null, "custom_reading_list": 0, "custom_types": "eBook", "flags": 1, "has_cover": 1, "id": 124, "identifier_ids": "408,406,407", "identifiers": [{"book": 124, "id": 407, "name": "ISBN", "path": "https://www.worldcat.org/isbn/9780385545693", "sort": "isbn", "type": "isbn", "val": "9780385545693"}, {"book": 124, "id": 406, "name": "Google Books", "path": "https://books.google.com/books?id=Qb4IEAAAQBAJ", "sort": "google", "type": "google", "val": "Qb4IEAAAQBAJ"}, {"book": 124, "id": 408, "name": "Goodreads", "path": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43868109", "sort": "goodreads", "type": "goodreads", "val": "43868109"}], "isbn": "9780385545693", "language_ids": "1", "languages": [{"avg_rating": 8.429245283018869, "count": 341, "id": 1, "name": "ENG", "sort": "ENG"}], "last_modified": "2023-05-04 17:55:52.136675+00:00", "order_by": "2022-10-05 15:54:07.602947+00:00", "path": "Patrick Radden Keefe/Empire of Pain_ The Secret History (124)", "pubdate": "2021-04-13", "publisher_ids": "82", "publishers": [{"avg_rating": 8.5, "count": 5, "id": 82, "name": "Knopf Publishing Group", "sort": "Knopf Publishing Group"}], "rating": 5, "series": [], "series_ids": null, "size": 5759595, "tag_ids": "51,57,58,60,92,194", "tags": [{"avg_rating": 8.333333333333334, "count": 40, "id": 194, "name": "Time", "sort": 40}, {"avg_rating": 8.222222222222221, "count": 31, "id": 92, "name": "Biography", "sort": 31}, {"avg_rating": 8.363636363636363, "count": 24, "id": 60, "name": "History", "sort": 24}, {"avg_rating": 8.347826086956522, "count": 23, "id": 57, "name": "Politics", "sort": 23}, {"avg_rating": 8.2, "count": 11, "id": 51, "name": "Business", "sort": 11}, {"avg_rating": 8.222222222222221, "count": 11, "id": 58, "name": "Science", "sort": 11}], "timestamp": "2022-10-05 15:54:07.602947+00:00", "title": "Empire of Pain: The Secret History of the Sackler Dynasty"}, {"author_ids": "125", "authors": [{"avg_rating": 8.0, "count": 1, "id": 125, "name": "Viet Thanh Nguyen", "sort": "Nguyen, Viet Thanh"}], "comments": "\u003cdiv\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sequel to The Sympathizer, which won the 2016 Pulitzer Prize in Fiction and went on to sell over a million copies worldwide, The Committed tells the story of \u201cthe man of two minds\u201d as he comes as a refugee to France and turns his hand to capitalism\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe long-awaited follow-up to the Pulitzer Prize-winning The Sympathizer, which has sold more than one million copies worldwide, The Committed follows the man of two minds as he arrives in Paris in the early 1980s with his blood brother Bon.

Beginning in his hometown of New Orleans, Clint Smith leads the reader on an unforgettable tour of monuments and landmarks--those that are honest about the past and those that are not--that offer an intergenerational story of how slavery has been central in shaping our nation\u0027s collective history, and ourselves. It is the story of the Monticello Plantation in Virginia, the estate where Thomas Jefferson wrote letters espousing the urgent need for liberty while enslaving more than four hundred people. It is the story of the Whitney Plantation, one of the only former plantations devoted to preserving the experience of the enslaved people whose lives and work sustained it. It is the story of Angola, a former plantation-turned-maximum-security prison in Louisiana that is filled with Black men who work across the 18,000-acre land for virtually no pay. And it is the story of Blandford Cemetery, the final resting place of tens of thousands of Confederate soldiers. A deeply researched and transporting exploration of the legacy of slavery and its imprint on centuries of American history, How the Word Is Passed illustrates how some of our country\u0027s most essential stories are hidden in plain view--whether in places we might drive by on our way to work, holidays such as Juneteenth, or entire neighborhoods like downtown Manhattan, where the brutal history of the trade in enslaved men, women, and children has been deeply imprinted. Informed by scholarship and brought to life by the story of people living today, Smith\u0027s debut work of nonfiction is a landmark of reflection and insight that offers a new understanding of the hopeful role that memory and history can play in making sense of our country and how it has come to be.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e", "custom_clean": 1, "custom_lists": [{"id": 5, "sort": "Must Read.2021 Time", "value": "Must Read.2021 Time"}], "custom_lists_ids": "5", "custom_read_date": null, "custom_reading_list": 0, "custom_types": "eBook", "flags": 1, "has_cover": 1, "id": 113, "identifier_ids": "374,376,375,377", "identifiers": [{"book": 113, "id": 377, "name": "ISBN", "path": "https://www.worldcat.org/isbn/9780316492935", "sort": "isbn", "type": "isbn", "val": "9780316492935"}, {"book": 113, "id": 375, "name": "Google Books", "path": "https://books.google.com/books?id=8pEHzgEACAAJ", "sort": "google", "type": "google", "val": "8pEHzgEACAAJ"}, {"book": 113, "id": 376, "name": "Goodreads", "path": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/55643287", "sort": "goodreads", "type": "goodreads", "val": "55643287"}, {"book": 113, "id": 374, "name": "Amazon", "path": "https://amazon.com/dp/0316492930", "sort": "amazon", "type": "amazon", "val": "0316492930"}], "isbn": "9780316492935", "language_ids": "1", "languages": [{"avg_rating": 8.429245283018869, "count": 341, "id": 1, "name": "ENG", "sort": "ENG"}], "last_modified": "2023-05-04 17:55:52.136675+00:00", "order_by": "2022-10-05 15:54:03.677102+00:00", "path": "Clint Smith/How the Word Is Passed_ A Reckoning (113)", "pubdate": "2021-06-01", "publisher_ids": "68", "publishers": [{"avg_rating": 8.5, "count": 4, "id": 68, "name": "Little, Brown and Company", "sort": "Little, Brown and Company"}], "rating": 5, "series": [], "series_ids": null, "size": 568333, "tag_ids": "57,60,194", "tags": [{"avg_rating": 8.333333333333334, "count": 40, "id": 194, "name": "Time", "sort": 40}, {"avg_rating": 8.363636363636363, "count": 24, "id": 60, "name": "History", "sort": 24}, {"avg_rating": 8.347826086956522, "count": 23, "id": 57, "name": "Politics", "sort": 23}], "timestamp": "2022-10-05 15:54:03.677102+00:00", "title": "How the Word Is Passed: A Reckoning With the History of Slavery Across America"}, {"author_ids": "114", "authors": [{"avg_rating": 10.0, "count": 1, "id": 114, "name": "Andrea Elliott", "sort": "Elliott, Andrea"}], "comments": "\u003cdiv\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn Invisible Child, Pulitzer Prize winner Andrea Elliott follows eight dramatic years in the life of Dasani, a girl whose imagination is as soaring as the skyscrapers near her Brooklyn shelter.

For fans of Tina Fey, David Sedaris and anyone who\u0027s ever felt like a misfit, an outrageously funny and disturbing memoir from Jenny Lawson, aka The Bloggess. \u0027When I tell people that my father is kind of a total lunatic, they laugh and nod knowingly. they assure me that theirs is too, and that he\u0027s just a \"typical father\". And they\u0027re probably right, if the typical father runs a full-time taxidermy business out of the house, and shows up at the local bar with a miniature donkey and a teddy Roosevelt impersonator, and thinks other people are weird for making such a big deal out of it. If the typical father says things like \"Happy birthday! Here\u0027s a bathtub of raccoons!\" or \"We\u0027ll have to take your car. Mine has too much blood in it,\" then yeah, he\u0027s totally normal.\u0027 When Jenny Lawson was little, all she ever wanted was to fit in. that dream was cut short by her fantastically unbalanced father and a childhood of wearing winter shoes made out of used bread sacks. It did, however, open up an opportunity for Lawson to find the humour in the strange shame-spiral that is her life, and we are all the better for it. Lawson\u0027s long-suffering husband and sweet daughter help her uncover the surprising discovery that the most terribly human moments - the ones we want to pretend never happened - are the very same moments that make us the people we are today. Like laughing at a funeral, LEt\u0027S PREtEND tHIS NEVER HAPPENED is both irreverent and impossible to hold back once you get started. \u0027the Bloggess writes stuff that actually is laugh-out-loud, but you know that really you shouldn\u0027t be laughing and probably you\u0027ll go to hell for laughing, so maybe you shouldn\u0027t read it.\u0027 Neil Gaiman \u0027Even when I was funny, I wasn\u0027t this funny.\u0027 Augusten Burroughs, author of RUNNING WItH SCISSORS\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e", "custom_clean": 1, "custom_lists": [], "custom_lists_ids": null, "custom_read_date": "2021-10-06", "custom_reading_list": 0, "custom_types": "eBook", "flags": 1, "has_cover": 1, "id": 98, "identifier_ids": "244,243,241,242", "identifiers": [{"book": 98, "id": 242, "name": "ISBN", "path": "https://www.worldcat.org/isbn/9781743096444", "sort": "isbn", "type": "isbn", "val": "9781743096444"}, {"book": 98, "id": 241, "name": "Google Books", "path": "https://books.google.com/books?id=9XJnMt0sXp4C", "sort": "google", "type": "google", "val": "9XJnMt0sXp4C"}, {"book": 98, "id": 243, "name": "Goodreads", "path": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35284712", "sort": "goodreads", "type": "goodreads", "val": "35284712"}, {"book": 98, "id": 244, "name": "Amazon", "path": "https://amazon.com/dp/0425261018", "sort": "amazon", "type": "amazon", "val": "0425261018"}], "isbn": "9781743096444", "language_ids": "1", "languages": [{"avg_rating": 8.429245283018869, "count": 341, "id": 1, "name": "ENG", "sort": "ENG"}], "last_modified": "2022-10-06 17:19:38.709950+00:00", "order_by": "2022-10-05 15:04:19.746379+00:00", "path": "Jenny Lawson/Let\u0027s Pretend This Never Happened (98)", "pubdate": "2012-04-17", "publisher_ids": "32", "publishers": [{"avg_rating": 9.0, "count": 29, "id": 32, "name": "HarperCollins", "sort": "HarperCollins"}], "rating": 4, "series": [], "series_ids": null, "size": 4201264, "tag_ids": "92", "tags": [{"avg_rating": 8.222222222222221, "count": 31, "id": 92, "name": "Biography", "sort": 31}], "timestamp": "2022-10-05 15:04:19.746379+00:00", "title": "Let\u0027s Pretend This Never Happened"}, {"author_ids": "102", "authors": [{"avg_rating": 8.0, "count": 1, "id": 102, "name": "Mindy Kaling", "sort": "Kaling, Mindy"}], "comments": "\u003cdiv\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMindy Kaling has lived many lives: the obedient child of immigrant professionals, a timid chubster afraid of her own bike, a Ben Affleck\u2013impersonating Off-Broadway performer and playwright, and, finally, a comedy writer and actress prone to starting fights with her friends and coworkers with the sentence \u201cCan I just say one last thing about this, and then I swear I\u2019ll shut up about it?\u201d\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerhaps you want to know what Mindy thinks makes a great best friend (someone who will fill your prescription in the middle of the night), or what makes a great guy (one who is aware of all elderly people in any room at any time and acts accordingly), or what is the perfect amount of fame (so famous you can never get convicted of murder in a court of law), or how to maintain a trim figure (you will not find that information in these pages).

In A Game of Thrones, an ancient kingdom was torn by the ambitions of ruthless men and women; in A Clash of Kings, war, sorcery, and madness swept over the kingdom like a voracious beast of prey. Now, as the brutal struggle for power nears its tumultuous climax, the battered and divided kingdom faces its most terrifying invasion\u2014one that is being spearheaded from beyond the grave....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA STORM OF SWORDS\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf the five contenders for power, one is dead, another in disfavor, and still the wars rage as violently as ever, as alliances are made and broken. Joffrey, of House Lannister, sits on the Iron Throne, the uneasy ruler of the land of the Seven Kingdoms. His most bitter rival, Lord Stannis, stands defeated and disgraced, the victim of the jealous sorceress who holds him in her evil thrall. But young Robb, of House Stark, still rules the North from the fortress of Riverrun. Robb plots against his despised Lannister enemies, even as they hold his sister hostage at King\u0027s Landing, the seat of the Iron Throne. Meanwhile, making her way across a blood-drenched continent is the exiled queen, Daenerys, mistress of the only three dragons still left in the world. Filled with the stench of death and decay from the destructive dynastic war, Daenerys is gathering allies and strength for an assault on King\u0027s Landing, hoping to win back the crown she believes is rightfully hers. But as opposing forces maneuver for the final titanic showdown, an army of barbaric wildlings bent on overwhelming the Seven Kingdoms arrives from the outermost line of civilization. In their vanguard is a horde of mythical Others\u2014a supernatural army of the living dead whose animated corpses are unstoppable. And as the future of the land hangs in the balance, no one will rest in the quest for victory until the Seven Kingdoms have exploded in a veritable storm of swords.... Brilliantly conceived and grand in scope, A Storm of Swords is the incredible tale of a world of harsh beauty and powerful magic, torn by treachery, ravaged by brutality, and consumed by greed and ambition. It portrays a war-torn landscape in which nobles and commoners, heroes and villains, the freeborn and the enslaved, all struggle to survive and to find their destinies...along with the dazzling bounty and wondrous enchantment that was once their birthright in the Seven Kingdoms.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e", "custom_clean": 1, "custom_lists": [], "custom_lists_ids": null, "custom_read_date": null, "custom_reading_list": 0, "custom_types": "eBook", "flags": 1, "has_cover": 1, "id": 79, "identifier_ids": "183,184,181,182,180", "identifiers": [{"book": 79, "id": 180, "name": "ISBN", "path": "https://www.worldcat.org/isbn/9780553106633", "sort": "isbn", "type": "isbn", "val": "9780553106633"}, {"book": 79, "id": 182, "name": "Google Books", "path": "https://books.google.com/books?id=YxpbAAAAMAAJ", "sort": "google", "type": "google", "val": "YxpbAAAAMAAJ"}, {"book": 79, "id": 181, "name": "Goodreads", "path": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10396652", "sort": "goodreads", "type": "goodreads", "val": "10396652"}, {"book": 79, "id": 184, "name": "Barnes \u0026 Noble", "path": "https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/storm-of-swords-george-r-r-martin/1100179865", "sort": "barnesnoble", "type": "barnesnoble", "val": "w/storm-of-swords-george-r-r-martin/1100179865"}, {"book": 79, "id": 183, "name": "Amazon", "path": "https://amazon.com/dp/0553106635", "sort": "amazon", "type": "amazon", "val": "0553106635"}], "isbn": "9780553106633", "language_ids": "1", "languages": [{"avg_rating": 8.429245283018869, "count": 341, "id": 1, "name": "ENG", "sort": "ENG"}], "last_modified": "2022-10-06 17:19:38.709950+00:00", "order_by": "2022-10-04 19:44:41.482947+00:00", "path": "George R.R.

In a land where summers can last decades and winters a lifetime, trouble is brewing. The cold is returning, and in the frozen wastes to the north of Winterfell, sinister forces are massing beyond the kingdom\u0027s protective Wall. To the south, the king\u0027s powers are failing--his most trusted adviser dead under mysterious circumstances and his enemies emerging from the shadows of the throne.

Very soon he\u0027s lured from his duties into a hunt for a fantastic treasure discovered by archaeologists and carefully hushed up. The long-vanished Martians who once colonised the galaxy have left a buried hyperspace gateway leading to a working starship in distant orbit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKovacs uses frightening violence to get the attention of corporate sponsors even more ruthless than himself. His hastily assembled exploration team must work in a lethal fallout zone, racing to open the gate before they\u0027re stopped by radiation sickness, treacherous sabotage, or the threat of fast-evolving nanoweaponry. And there are repeated hints that if they ever make it through that gateway, worse things are waiting on the far side...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0027s all desperately tense and crafted with appalling inventiveness. Life is cheap and death is no release, because the \"cortical stack\" implanted in everyone\u0027s spine constantly records the total personality, ready for \"re-sleeving\" in a new clone body or storage in virtual reality. So Kovacs goes recruiting at the macabre Soul Market, where thanks to the war there are literal skiploads of hacked-out sections of human spine containing stacks--for sale by the kilogram.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOther ingredients include sex, voodoo, torture, multiple betrayal, cool military technology, incomprehensible alien constructions, age-old cycles of catastrophe, and--above all--extreme violence. The screw is turned further and further, beyond what seems possible. Readers may find themselves forgetting to breathe. This is a rattling good yarn, for the strong of stomach. --David Langford\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e", "custom_clean": 1, "custom_lists": [], "custom_lists_ids": null, "custom_read_date": "2022-06-08", "custom_reading_list": 0, "custom_types": "eBook", "flags": 1, "has_cover": 1, "id": 75, "identifier_ids": "169,168,166,167", "identifiers": [{"book": 75, "id": 167, "name": "ISBN", "path": "https://www.worldcat.org/isbn/9780575075504", "sort": "isbn", "type": "isbn", "val": "9780575075504"}, {"book": 75, "id": 166, "name": "Google Books", "path": "https://books.google.com/books?id=H_FyPwAACAAJ", "sort": "google", "type": "google", "val": "H_FyPwAACAAJ"}, {"book": 75, "id": 168, "name": "Goodreads", "path": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1117988", "sort": "goodreads", "type": "goodreads", "val": "1117988"}, {"book": 75, "id": 169, "name": "Amazon", "path": "https://amazon.com/dp/0345457714", "sort": "amazon", "type": "amazon", "val": "0345457714"}], "isbn": "9780575075504", "language_ids": "1", "languages": [{"avg_rating": 8.429245283018869, "count": 341, "id": 1, "name": "ENG", "sort": "ENG"}], "last_modified": "2022-10-06 17:19:38.709950+00:00", "order_by": "2022-10-04 19:29:45.875671+00:00", "path": "Richard K.

Kovacs can deal with the madness of AI. He can do his part in a battle against biomachines gone wild, search for a three-centuries-old missing weapons system, and live with a blood feud with the yakuza, and even with the betrayal of people he once trusted. But when his relationship with \u201cthe\u201d Falconer brings him an enemy specially designed to destroy him, he knows it\u2019s time to be afraid.

It Doesn\u0027t Have to Be Crazy at Work is a direct successor to Rework, the instant bestseller that showed readers a new path to working effectively. Now Fried and Heinemeier Hansson have returned with a new strategy for the ideal company culture - what they call the calm company . It is a direct attack on the chaos, anxiety and stress that plagues millions of workplaces and billions of people working their day jobs. Working to breaking point with long hours, excessive workload, and a lack of sleep have become a badge of honour for many people these days, when it should be a mark of stupidity. This isn\u0027t just a problem for large organisations; individuals, contractors and solopreneurs are burning themselves out in the very same way. As the authors reveal, the answer isn\u0027t more hours. Rather, it\u0027s less waste and fewer things that induce distraction, always-on anxiety and stress. It is time to stop celebrating crazy and start celebrating calm. Fried and Hansson have the proof to back up their argument. Calm has been the cornerstone of their company\u0027s culture since Basecamp began twenty years ago. Destined to become the management guide for the next generation, It Doesn\u0027t Have to Be Crazy at Work is a practical and inspiring distillation of their insights and experiences. It isn\u0027t a book telling you what to do.

When we bring both respect and interpersonal savvy to our work relationships, we do more than make people feel good. We enhance personal and organizational performance. And as the workplace grows more complex and competitive, managing our work relationships becomes even more essential and difficult. Now more than ever we need to work people smart. Working PeopleSmart describes the six core strategies used by people-smart individuals and shows how to apply them in the toughest workplace situations. Individuals who are people smart know how to open others up rather than make them defensive or resistant. They have a knack for diffusing tension rather than creating it. They set a good example through their own behavior on the job and can inspire and influence others with less developed skills. Working PeopleSmart can serve as your virtual coach to guide you through difficult work relationships skillfully. How do you deal with a critical colleague? Make your boss listen to you? React to an offensive joke? Get the resources you need? The authors look at over 50 real-life situations and offer people-smart prescriptions for handling them effectively. They provide coaching tips for each scenario and describe exactly what a people-smart response sounds like. As two psychologists with both organizational and clinical expertise, coauthors Mel Silberman and Freda Hansburg are highly qualified to deliver the message that we can emerge from even the toughest interpersonal moments on the job with dignity and grace. Where other books rely on typologies that categorize people according to their interpersonal styles and then offer advice on how to deal with each type, the strategies described in Working PeopleSmart are straightforward and universal. They can be used immediately to deal with any type of person or any situation, no matter how difficult or sensitive.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e", "custom_clean": 1, "custom_lists": [], "custom_lists_ids": null, "custom_read_date": null, "custom_reading_list": 0, "custom_types": "eBook", "flags": 1, "has_cover": 1, "id": 34, "identifier_ids": "122,121,123", "identifiers": [{"book": 34, "id": 123, "name": "ISBN", "path": "https://www.worldcat.org/isbn/9781576752081", "sort": "isbn", "type": "isbn", "val": "9781576752081"}, {"book": 34, "id": 121, "name": "Google Books", "path": "https://books.google.com/books?id=YZgNngEACAAJ", "sort": "google", "type": "google", "val": "YZgNngEACAAJ"}, {"book": 34, "id": 122, "name": "Goodreads", "path": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1946690", "sort": "goodreads", "type": "goodreads", "val": "1946690"}], "isbn": "9781576752081", "language_ids": "1", "languages": [{"avg_rating": 8.429245283018869, "count": 341, "id": 1, "name": "ENG", "sort": "ENG"}], "last_modified": "2022-10-06 17:19:38.709950+00:00", "order_by": "2022-10-04 13:46:41.441000+00:00", "path": "Melvin L.

So we settle for who we are, instead of striving for who we were meant to be.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRelease Your Brilliance provides the combination to the vault where your brilliance is kept. After struggling for thirty-two years with disillusion, defeat, and despair, author Simon T.

Using the metaphor that we\u0027re all diamonds in the rough, Simon shares the four key steps to cut and polish the gem that is you in order to reawaken your genius, reignite your internal light, and release your potential. He guides your transformation with interactive tools such as Personal Appraisal exercises, Diamond Polishing action steps, and true stories of Living Diamonds.

She then journeyed to the region of Geneva, Switzerland, where much of the story takes place. The topic of galvanism and occult ideas were themes of conversation among her companions, particularly her lover and future husband Percy B. Shelley. Mary, Percy and Lord Byron had a competition to see who could write the best horror story.

In the newest appealing installment of the Discworld series, Pratchett (The Truth) takes on religion, time and... kung-fu movies? The cast includes Death; Miss Susan, Death\u0027s granddaughter; Jeremy Clockson, a clockmaker; Lobsang, a novice monk; and Lu-Tze, a sweeper at the temple of the History Monks. When a mysterious lady asks Jeremy to make a clock that is perfectly timed (even to the last tick), trouble begins it seems that such a clock would have the power to stop time completely. There would be no yesterday, no tomorrow, no next minute; in fact, everything and everyone would stop in its tracks. It\u0027s up to Miss Susan, Lobsang and Lu-Tze to figure out who in the end has decided to build the dangerous clock and how to stop him before the world crashes to a halt. Along the way we learn Rule One: \"Do not act incautiously when confronting a little bald wrinkly smiling man,\" which is a very good lesson to learn. We also find out that Lobsang has more in store for his future than to be an apprentice monk. The story includes a quick nod to James Bond flicks with Qu, the monk who supplies gadgets to Lu-Tze and Lobsang, and at the end of Time the four (no, make that five) horsemen of the Apocalypse get to ride out for a jaunt. You don\u0027t need to catch all the in-jokes to enjoy the fun.

He explains that work that demands your full focus is intrinsically valuable and rewarding. You need to be able to handle \"deep work\" to succeed in an information economy. Yet people face increasing distractions or social pressure that drive them toward shallow work. Newport develops his ideas with a blend of formal research, stories and personal accounts about the challenges and rewards of deep work. He provides tips for arranging your life to support deep work, which he sees as valuable, productive and rare. He makes his case persuasively and even poetically. getAbstract recommends his guidance to knowledge workers and anyone else who is seeking flow, creativity or focus.

Fans seem driven to expand on the games they love. For some, this may involve mods (for the games that allow that). Others do artwork, or music. Others write stories. Some attempt to write novels based on the games, but sadly many fan novelizations of games are little more than transcripts. There is at least one that isn\u0027t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFirst appearing in installments on the now-defunct website Glottis\u0027 Garage, the Grim Fandango novel by MeddlingMonk was initially well received. Although still sought after, it has become increasingly hard to find. Many plot points are developed more fully and the entire text has been tweaked to become more textured, more adult. If the game was intended to reflect film noir, then the novel is meant to key off of the writings of Dashiell Hammett, Raymond Chandler and Ross Macdonald.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlthough adapted from an episodic game, the Grim Fandango novel presents a continuous story, filling in the gaps using hints from the game itself (including unused elements found in the game\u0027s data) or by using reasonable extrapolations. The result has given some readers the eerie feeling--despite knowing better--that it is the game that is the adaptation. If Tim Schafer had been a hardboiled novelist rather than a game designer, he might have come up with something like this.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e", "custom_clean": 1, "custom_lists": [], "custom_lists_ids": null, "custom_read_date": null, "custom_reading_list": 0, "custom_types": "Comic", "flags": 1, "has_cover": 1, "id": 362, "identifier_ids": null, "identifiers": [], "isbn": null, "language_ids": "1", "languages": [{"avg_rating": 8.429245283018869, "count": 341, "id": 1, "name": "ENG", "sort": "ENG"}], "last_modified": "2023-07-16 18:56:10.618541+00:00", "order_by": "2020-05-26 21:33:05.709000+00:00", "path": "Charles Frederick/Grim Fandango (362)", "pubdate": "2008-05-14", "publisher_ids": "117", "publishers": [{"avg_rating": 7.6, "count": 15, "id": 117, "name": "Independently Published", "sort": "Independently Published"}], "rating": null, "series": [], "series_ids": null, "size": 2968699, "tag_ids": "184,369", "tags": [{"avg_rating": 8.435897435897436, "count": 58, "id": 184, "name": "Comics \u0026 Graphic Novels", "sort": 58}, {"avg_rating": 4.0, "count": 5, "id": 369, "name": "Games", "sort": 5}], "timestamp": "2020-05-26 21:33:05.709000+00:00", "title": "Grim Fandango"}, {"author_ids": "246", "authors": [{"avg_rating": null, "count": 1, "id": 246, "name": "Mark Twain", "sort": "Twain, Mark"}], "comments": "\u003cdiv\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHilariously picaresque, epic in scope, alive with the poetry and vigor of the American people, Mark Twain\u0027s story about a young boy and his journey down the Mississippi was the first great novel to speak in a truly American voice.

In 1942, with Nazis occupying Holland, a thirteen-year-old Jewish girl and her family fled their home in Amsterdam and went into hiding. For the next two years, until their whereabouts were betrayed to the Gestapo, they and another family lived cloistered in the \"Secret Annex\" of an old office building. Cut off from the outside world, they faced hunger, boredom, the constant cruelties of living in confined quarters, and the ever-present threat of discovery and death. In her diary Anne Frank recorded vivid impressions of her experiences during this period. By turns thoughtful, moving, and amusing, her account offers a fascinating commentary on human courage and frailty and a compelling self-portrait of a sensitive and spirited young woman whose promise was tragically cut short.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e", "custom_clean": 1, "custom_lists": [{"id": 14, "sort": "Must Read.25 Must Read", "value": "Must Read.25 Must Read"}], "custom_lists_ids": "14", "custom_read_date": null, "custom_reading_list": 0, "custom_types": "eBook", "flags": 1, "has_cover": 1, "id": 437, "identifier_ids": "1264,1265", "identifiers": [{"book": 437, "id": 1265, "name": "ISBN", "path": "https://www.worldcat.org/isbn/9780553577129", "sort": "isbn", "type": "isbn", "val": "9780553577129"}, {"book": 437, "id": 1264, "name": "Google Books", "path": "https://books.google.com/books?id=Z-SoMQEACAAJ", "sort": "google", "type": "google", "val": "Z-SoMQEACAAJ"}], "isbn": "9780553577129", "language_ids": "1", "languages": [{"avg_rating": 8.429245283018869, "count": 341, "id": 1, "name": "ENG", "sort": "ENG"}], "last_modified": "2023-07-21 14:29:11.123443+00:00", "order_by": "2020-03-03 23:00:00+00:00", "path": "Anne Frank/The Diary of a Young Girl_ The Defi (437)", "pubdate": "1997-07-14", "publisher_ids": "212", "publishers": [{"avg_rating": 8.0, "count": 1, "id": 212, "name": "Bantam Books", "sort": "Bantam Books"}], "rating": 4, "series": [], "series_ids": null, "size": 480624, "tag_ids": "60,428,438,439", "tags": [{"avg_rating": 8.363636363636363, "count": 24, "id": 60, "name": "History", "sort": 24}, {"avg_rating": 9.0, "count": 2, "id": 428, "name": "Holocaust", "sort": 2}, {"avg_rating": 8.0, "count": 1, "id": 438, "name": "Holocaust; Jewish", "sort": 1}, {"avg_rating": 8.0, "count": 1, "id": 439, "name": "Netherlands", "sort": 1}], "timestamp": "2020-03-03 23:00:00+00:00", "title": "The Diary of a Young Girl: The Definitive Edition"}, {"author_ids": "465", "authors": [{"avg_rating": 10.0, "count": 2, "id": 465, "name": "John Steinbeck", "sort": "Steinbeck, John"}], "comments": "\u003cdiv\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFirst published in 1939, Steinbeck\u2019s Pulitzer Prize-winning epic of the Great Depression chronicles the Dust Bowl migration of the 1930s and tells the story of one Oklahoma farm family, the Joads\u2014driven from their homestead and forced to travel west to the promised land of California. Out of their trials and their repeated collisions against the hard realities of an America divided into Haves and Have-Nots evolves a drama that is intensely human yet majestic in its scale and moral vision, elemental yet plainspoken, tragic but ultimately stirring in its human dignity. A portrait of the conflict between the powerful and the powerless, of one man\u2019s fierce reaction to injustice, and of one woman\u2019s stoical strength, the novel captures the horrors of the Great Depression and probes into the very nature of equality and justice in America. At once a naturalistic epic, captivity narrative, road novel, and transcendental gospel, Steinbeck\u2019s powerful landmark novel is perhaps the most American of American Classics. \u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e", "custom_clean": 1, "custom_lists": [{"id": 14, "sort": "Must Read.25 Must Read", "value": "Must Read.25 Must Read"}], "custom_lists_ids": "14", "custom_read_date": null, "custom_reading_list": 0, "custom_types": "eBook", "flags": 1, "has_cover": 1, "id": 446, "identifier_ids": "1239,1238,1240", "identifiers": [{"book": 446, "id": 1240, "name": "ISBN", "path": "https://www.worldcat.org/isbn/9780143039433", "sort": "isbn", "type": "isbn", "val": "9780143039433"}, {"book": 446, "id": 1238, "name": "Google Books", "path": "https://books.google.com/books?id=bhJgd3hGdxQC", "sort": "google", "type": "google", "val": "bhJgd3hGdxQC"}, {"book": 446, "id": 1239, "name": "Amazon", "path": "https://amazon.com/dp/0143039431", "sort": "amazon", "type": "amazon", "val": "0143039431"}], "isbn": "9780143039433", "language_ids": "1", "languages": [{"avg_rating": 8.429245283018869, "count": 341, "id": 1, "name": "ENG", "sort": "ENG"}], "last_modified": "2023-07-21 14:32:47.527874+00:00", "order_by": "2020-03-03 23:00:00+00:00", "path": "John Steinbeck/The Grapes of Wrath (446)", "pubdate": "2006-03-27", "publisher_ids": "90", "publishers": [{"avg_rating": 8.8, "count": 20, "id": 90, "name": "Penguin Random House", "sort": "Penguin Random House"}], "rating": 5, "series": [], "series_ids": null, "size": 1950305, "tag_ids": "4,148,152,153,349,400,401,402,403,404,405,406,407", "tags": [{"avg_rating": 9.25, "count": 97, "id": 4, "name": "Fiction", "sort": 97}, {"avg_rating": 8.461538461538462, "count": 47, "id": 349, "name": "General", "sort": 47}, {"avg_rating": 8.578947368421053, "count": 28, "id": 153, "name": "Classics", "sort": 28}, {"avg_rating": 9.0, "count": 11, "id": 152, "name": "Literary", "sort": 11}, {"avg_rating": 9.333333333333334, "count": 5, "id": 148, "name": "Historical", "sort": 5}, {"avg_rating": 10.0, "count": 1, "id": 400, "name": "Domestic fiction", "sort": 1}, {"avg_rating": 10.0, "count": 1, "id": 401, "name": "Political fiction", "sort": 1}, {"avg_rating": 10.0, "count": 1, "id": 402, "name": "California", "sort": 1}, {"avg_rating": 10.0, "count": 1, "id": 403, "name": "Rural families", "sort": 1}, {"avg_rating": 10.0, "count": 1, "id": 404, "name": "Migrant agricultural laborers", "sort": 1}, {"avg_rating": 10.0, "count": 1, "id": 405, "name": "Depressions", "sort": 1}, {"avg_rating": 10.0, "count": 1, "id": 406, "name": "Labor camps", "sort": 1}, {"avg_rating": 10.0, "count": 1, "id": 407, "name": "Oklahoma", "sort": 1}], "timestamp": "2020-03-03 23:00:00+00:00", "title": "The Grapes of Wrath"}, {"author_ids": "484", "authors": [{"avg_rating": 10.0, "count": 1, "id": 484, "name": "Markus Zusak", "sort": "Zusak, Markus"}], "comments": "\u003cdiv\u003e\n\u003cp style=\"font-style: italic\"\u003eWhen Death has a story to tell, you listen. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt is 1939.

A classic of English literature, written with incisive wit and superb character delineation, it centres on the turbulent relationship between Elizabeth Bennet, the daughter of a country gentleman, and Fitzwilliam Darcy, a rich aristocratic landowner. The work, which Austen initially titled First Impressions, is the second of four novels that Austen published during her lifetime. Although Pride and Prejudice has been criticized for its lack of historical context, the existence of its characters in a social bubble that is rarely penetrated by events beyond it is an accurate portrayal of the enclosed social world in which Austen lived. She depicted that world, in all its own narrow pride and prejudice, with unswerving accuracy and satire. At the same time, she placed at its centre, as both its prime actor and most perceptive critic, a character so well conceived and rendered that the reader cannot but be gripped by her story and wish for its happy d\u00e9nouement. In the end, Austen\u0027s novel has remained popular largely because of Elizabeth-who was reportedly Austen\u0027s own favourite among all her heroines-and because of the enduring appeal to men and women alike of a well-told and potentially happily ending love story. Pride and Prejudice inspired various stage, film, and television productions. One of its most notable adaptations was a 1995 TV miniseries starring Jennifer Ehle (Elizabeth) and Colin Firth (Darcy). Parents need to know that Jane Austen\u0027s romantic masterpiece, Pride and Prejudice, is an absolute joy to read and study for teens who are open to the pleasures of 19th-century prose and manners.

After eighteen years as a political prisoner in the Bastille the aging Dr Manette is finally released and reunited with his daughter in England. There, two very different men, Charles Darnay, an exiled French aristocrat, and Sydney Carton, a disreputable but brilliant English lawyer, become enmeshed through their love for Lucie Manette. From the tranquil lanes of London, they are all drawn against their will to the vengeful, bloodstained streets of Paris at the height of the Reign of Terror and soon fall under the lethal shadow of La Guillotine.

Browne (\u0027Phiz\u0027).

Coding with Kotlin means less hassle. The Kotlin programming language offers an expressive syntax, a strong intuitive type system, and great tooling support along with seamless interoperability with existing Java code, libraries, and frameworks. Kotlin can be compiled to Java bytecode, so you can use it everywhere Java is used, including Android. And with an effi cient compiler and a small standard library, Kotlin imposes virtually no runtime overhead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAbout the Book\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKotlin in Action teaches you to use the Kotlin language for production-quality applications.

These important advances for security and privacy create new content moderation challenges for online services, because services can no longer directly access plaintext content. While ongoing public policy debates about E2EE and content moderation in the United States and European Union emphasize child sexual abuse material and misinformation in messaging and storage, we identify and synthesize a wealth of scholarship that goes far beyond those topics. We bridge literature that is diverse in both content moderation subject matter, such as malware, spam, hate speech, terrorist content, and enterprise policy compliance, as well as intended deployments, including not only privacy-preserving content moderation for messaging, email, and cloud storage, but also private introspection of encrypted web traffic by middleboxes. In this work, we systematize the study of content moderation in E2EE settings. We set out a process pipeline for content moderation, drawing on a broad interdisciplinary literature that is not specific to E2EE. We examine cryptography and policy design choices at all stages of this pipeline, and we suggest areas of future research to fill gaps in literature and better understand possible paths forward.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e", "custom_clean": 1, "custom_lists": [], "custom_lists_ids": null, "custom_read_date": null, "custom_reading_list": 1, "custom_types": "Paper", "flags": 1, "has_cover": 1, "id": 340, "identifier_ids": "1113", "identifiers": [{"book": 340, "id": 1113, "name": "arXiv", "path": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.03979", "sort": "arxiv", "type": "arxiv", "val": "2303.03979"}], "isbn": null, "language_ids": "1", "languages": [{"avg_rating": 8.429245283018869, "count": 341, "id": 1, "name": "ENG", "sort": "ENG"}], "last_modified": "2023-07-16 18:56:10.618541+00:00", "order_by": "2023-05-23 12:48:00.634174+00:00", "path": "Sarah Scheffler/SoK_ Content Moderation for End-to- (340)", "pubdate": "2023-03-08", "publisher_ids": "125", "publishers": [{"avg_rating": null, "count": 9, "id": 125, "name": "arXiv", "sort": "arXiv"}], "rating": null, "series": [], "series_ids": null, "size": 1598984, "tag_ids": "191,350,351,352", "tags": [{"avg_rating": 7.857142857142857, "count": 28, "id": 191, "name": "Computer Science", "sort": 28}, {"avg_rating": null, "count": 1, "id": 350, "name": "End-to-End Encryption", "sort": 1}, {"avg_rating": null, "count": 1, "id": 351, "name": "Content Moderation", "sort": 1}, {"avg_rating": null, "count": 1, "id": 352, "name": "Privacy", "sort": 1}], "timestamp": "2023-05-23 12:48:00.634174+00:00", "title": "SoK: Content Moderation for End-to-End Encryption"}, {"author_ids": "379,380", "authors": [{"avg_rating": 8.0, "count": 1, "id": 380, "name": "Sophie Debenedetto", "sort": "Debenedetto, Sophie"}, {"avg_rating": 8.0, "count": 1, "id": 379, "name": "Bruce A.

Upgrade your web API to GraphQL, leveraging its flexible queries to empower your users, and its declarative structure to simplify your code. Absinthe is the GraphQL toolkit for Elixir, a functional programming language designed to enable massive concurrency atop robust application architectures. Written by the creators of Absinthe, this book will help you take full advantage of these two groundbreaking technologies. Build your own flexible, high-performance APIs using step-by-step guidance and expert advice you won\u0027t find anywhere else. GraphQL is a new way of structuring and building web services, and the result is transformational. Find out how to offer a more tailored, cohesive experience to your users, easily aggregate data from different data sources, and improve your back end\u0027s maintainability with Absinthe\u0027s declarative approach to defining how your API works. Build a GraphQL-based API from scratch using Absinthe, starting from core principles. Learn the type system and how to expand your schema to suit your application\u0027s needs. Discover a growing ecosystem of tools and utilities to understand, debug, and document your API. Take it to production, but do it safely with solid best practices in mind. Find out how complexity analysis and persisted queries can let you support your users flexibly, but responsibly too. Along the way, discover how Elixir makes all the difference for a high performance, fault-tolerant API. Use asynchronous and batching execution, or write your own custom add-ons to extend Absinthe. Go live with subscriptions, delivering data over websockets on top of Elixir (and Erlang/OTP\u0027s) famous solid performance and real-time capabilities. Transform your applications with the powerful combination of Elixir and GraphQL, using Absinthe. What You Need: To follow along with the book, you should have Erlang/OTP 19+ and Elixir 1.4+ installed.

Sigmund Freud is an Austrian neurologist and the founding father of psychoanalysis, a method for treating mental illness and also a theory that explains human behavior. Freud believed that events in our childhood hold a great impact on our adult lives, shaping our personality. In creating psychoanalysis, Freud designed therapeutic techniques such as the use of free association and discovered transference, establishing its central role in the analytic process. Freud saw that man is at war with himself and often unable to tolerate too much reality.

The author pulls from her experience with Silicon Valley\u2019s hottest companies to teach practical insights on OKRs in the form of a fable.When Hanna and Jack receive an ultimatum from the only investor in their struggling tea supply company, they must learn how to employ Objectives and Key Results (OKRs) with radical focus to get the right things done. Using Hanna and Jack\u2019s story, Wodtke walks readers through how to inspire a diverse team to work together in pursuit of a single, challenging goal, and how to stay motivated despite setbacks and failures.Radical Focus has been translated into six languages and sold more than 50,000 copies. Now, the second edition of her OKR manifesto proves that Wodtke\u2019s business strategies are essential in a world where focus seems to be a more and more unreachable goal. The updated version includes 22,000 words of all-new material designed to help OKR users in larger companies create, grade, and manage OKRs in ways that accelerate success and drive rapid organizational learning.Ready to move your team in the right direction?

They seek Gildiner\u0027s help to overcome an immediate challenge in their lives, but discover that the source of their suffering has been long buried.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs in such recent classics as The Glass Castle and Educated , each patient embodies self-reflection, stoicism, perseverance, and forgiveness as they work unflinchingly to face the truth. Gildiner\u0027s account of her journeys with them is moving, insightful, and sometimes very funny. Good Morning Monster offers an almost novelistic, behind-the-scenes look into the therapist\u0027s office, illustrating how the process can heal even the most unimaginable wounds.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e", "custom_clean": 1, "custom_lists": [], "custom_lists_ids": null, "custom_read_date": null, "custom_reading_list": 1, "custom_types": "eBook", "flags": 1, "has_cover": 1, "id": 266, "identifier_ids": "910,908,909,907", "identifiers": [{"book": 266, "id": 907, "name": "ISBN", "path": "https://www.worldcat.org/isbn/9781250272263", "sort": "isbn", "type": "isbn", "val": "9781250272263"}, {"book": 266, "id": 909, "name": "Google Books", "path": "https://books.google.com/books?id=Hi_QDwAAQBAJ", "sort": "google", "type": "google", "val": "Hi_QDwAAQBAJ"}, {"book": 266, "id": 908, "name": "Goodreads", "path": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/49127514", "sort": "goodreads", "type": "goodreads", "val": "49127514"}, {"book": 266, "id": 910, "name": "Amazon", "path": "https://amazon.com/dp/B084M1M1DZ", "sort": "amazon", "type": "amazon", "val": "B084M1M1DZ"}], "isbn": "9781250272263", "language_ids": "1", "languages": [{"avg_rating": 8.429245283018869, "count": 341, "id": 1, "name": "ENG", "sort": "ENG"}], "last_modified": "2023-05-04 17:55:52.136675+00:00", "order_by": "2023-03-16 21:47:14.891082+00:00", "path": "Catherine Gildiner/Good Morning, Monster_ A Therapist (266)", "pubdate": "2020-09-22", "publisher_ids": "169", "publishers": [{"avg_rating": 8.0, "count": 1, "id": 169, "name": "St. Martin\u0027s Press", "sort": "St. Martin\u0027s Press"}], "rating": 4, "series": [], "series_ids": null, "size": 822130, "tag_ids": "31,43,50,70,92,253,254,255", "tags": [{"avg_rating": 8.421052631578947, "count": 38, "id": 50, "name": "Adult", "sort": 38}, {"avg_rating": 8.222222222222221, "count": 31, "id": 92, "name": "Biography", "sort": 31}, {"avg_rating": 8.0, "count": 27, "id": 43, "name": "Self Help", "sort": 27}, {"avg_rating": 8.0, "count": 20, "id": 31, "name": "Psychology", "sort": 20}, {"avg_rating": 8.0, "count": 7, "id": 70, "name": "Health", "sort": 7}, {"avg_rating": 8.0, "count": 2, "id": 253, "name": "Non-Fiction", "sort": 2}, {"avg_rating": 8.0, "count": 1, "id": 254, "name": "Memoir", "sort": 1}, {"avg_rating": 8.0, "count": 1, "id": 255, "name": "Mental Health", "sort": 1}], "timestamp": "2023-03-16 21:47:14.891082+00:00", "title": "Good Morning, Monster: A Therapist Shares Five Heroic Stories of Emotional Recovery"}, {"author_ids": "350", "authors": [{"avg_rating": 8.0, "count": 1, "id": 350, "name": "Pam Grout", "sort": "Grout, Pam"}], "comments": "\u003cdiv\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eE-Squared could best be described as a lab manual with simple experiments to prove once and for all that reality is malleable, that consciousness trumps matter, and that you shape your life with your mind.

He\u0027s worked with celebrated chef Eric Ripert as wine director of three-Michelin-starred Le Bernardin for over a decade, yet his philosophy and approach to wine is much more casual. Aldo\u0027s debut book, Wine Simple, is full of confidence-building infographics and illustrations, an unbeatable depth of knowledge, effusive encouragement, and, most important, strong opinions on wine so you can learn to form your own. Imbued with Aldo\u0027s insatiable passion and eagerness to teach others, Wine Simple is accessible, deeply educational, and lively and fun, both in voice and visuals. This essential guide begins with the fundamentals of wine in easy-to-absorb hits of information and pragmatic, everyday tips\u2014key varietals and winemaking regions, how to taste, when to save and when to splurge, and how to set up a wine tasting at home. Aldo then teaches you how to take your wine knowledge to the next level and evolve your palate, including techniques on building a\u00a0\u201cflavor library,\u201d\u00a0a cheat sheet to good (and great) vintages (and why you shouldn\u0027t put everything on the line for them), tips on troubleshooting tricky wines (corked? mousy?), and, for the daring, even how to saber a bottle of champagne.

When it comes to improbable innovations, a legendary tech VC told Sebastian Mallaby, the future cannot be predicted, it can only be discovered. It is the nature of the venture-capital game that most attempts at discovery fail, but a very few succeed at such a scale that they more than make up for everything else. That extreme ratio of success and failure is the power law that drives the VC business, all of Silicon Valley, the wider tech sector, and, by extension, the world.\u00a0\u00a0 In The Power Law, Sebastian Mallaby has parlayed unprecedented access to the most celebrated venture capitalists of all time\u2014the key figures at Sequoia, Kleiner Perkins, Accel, Benchmark, and Andreessen Horowitz, as well as Chinese partnerships such as Qiming and Capital Today\u2014into a riveting blend of storytelling and analysis that unfurls the history of tech incubation, in the Valley and ultimately worldwide. We learn the unvarnished truth, often for the first time, about some of the most iconic triumphs and infamous disasters in Valley history, from the comedy of errors at the birth of Apple to the avalanche of venture money that fostered hubris at WeWork and Uber.\u00a0 VCs\u2019 relentless search for grand slams brews an obsession with the ideal of the lone entrepreneur-genius, and companies seen as potential \u201cunicorns\u201d are given intoxicating amounts of power, with sometimes disastrous results. On a more systemic level, the need to make outsized bets on unproven talent reinforces bias, with women and minorities still represented at woefully low levels. This does not just have social justice implications: as Mallaby relates, China\u2019s homegrown VC sector, having learned at the Valley\u2019s feet, is exploding and now has more women VC luminaries than America has ever had. Still, Silicon Valley VC remains the top incubator of business innovation anywhere\u2014it is not where ideas come from so much as where they go to become the products and companies that create the future. By taking us so deeply into the VCs\u2019 game, The Power Law helps us think about our own future through their eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e", "custom_clean": 1, "custom_lists": [], "custom_lists_ids": null, "custom_read_date": null, "custom_reading_list": 1, "custom_types": "eBook", "flags": 1, "has_cover": 1, "id": 257, "identifier_ids": "879,880", "identifiers": [{"book": 257, "id": 880, "name": "ISBN", "path": "https://www.worldcat.org/isbn/9780525560005", "sort": "isbn", "type": "isbn", "val": "9780525560005"}, {"book": 257, "id": 879, "name": "Google Books", "path": "https://books.google.com/books?id=a3YsEAAAQBAJ", "sort": "google", "type": "google", "val": "a3YsEAAAQBAJ"}], "isbn": "9780525560005", "language_ids": "1", "languages": [{"avg_rating": 8.429245283018869, "count": 341, "id": 1, "name": "ENG", "sort": "ENG"}], "last_modified": "2023-07-21 14:34:52.350604+00:00", "order_by": "2023-01-27 19:15:58.396903+00:00", "path": "Sebastian Mallaby/The Power Law_ Venture Capital and (257)", "pubdate": "2022-02-01", "publisher_ids": "90", "publishers": [{"avg_rating": 8.8, "count": 20, "id": 90, "name": "Penguin Random House", "sort": "Penguin Random House"}], "rating": null, "series": [], "series_ids": null, "size": 12214615, "tag_ids": "11,191,245,246", "tags": [{"avg_rating": 7.857142857142857, "count": 28, "id": 191, "name": "Computer Science", "sort": 28}, {"avg_rating": 8.2, "count": 13, "id": 11, "name": "Business \u0026 Economics", "sort": 13}, {"avg_rating": 10.0, "count": 2, "id": 245, "name": "Corporate Finance", "sort": 2}, {"avg_rating": 10.0, "count": 2, "id": 246, "name": "Venture Capital", "sort": 2}], "timestamp": "2023-01-27 19:15:58.396903+00:00", "title": "The Power Law: Venture Capital and the Making of the New Future"}, {"author_ids": "343", "authors": [{"avg_rating": 8.0, "count": 1, "id": 343, "name": "Sam Harris", "sort": "Harris, Sam"}], "comments": "\u003cdiv\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eProduct Description\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor the millions of Americans who want spirituality without religion, Sam Harris\u2019s latest New York Times bestseller is a guide to meditation as a rational practice informed by neuroscience and psychology.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom Sam Harris, neuroscientist and author of numerous New York Times bestselling books, Waking Up is for the twenty percent of Americans who follow no religion but who suspect that important truths can be found in the experiences of such figures as Jesus, the Buddha, Lao Tzu, Rumi, and the other saints and sages of history.

An acronym for \"Phenethylamines I Have Known and Loved\", the book spans autobiography, organic chemistry, politics, ethnobotany, and psychopharmacology, and the cultural impact is likely to be profound for decades to come, as it has already.

This first half of the book is The Love Story, about two people named Shura and Alice who fall in love, though one of them is already in love with someone else. This love triangle is a painful ordeal they must go through, and that process unfolds before the reader with grace and great insight into human nature. Shura is a brilliant chemist who has dedicated his career to making psychoactive drugs, in the story they go through many experiences with the psychedelic compounds that Shura has discovered and has made in his lab, all of which have been bioassayed himself. The reader will find themselves going on this journey with them, experiencing what they experienced, both in their hearts and in the psychedelic journeys they have. The second half of PiHKAL is called The Chemical Story, and it contains detailed instructions for, and effects of, the synthesis of 179 psychedelic phenethylamines which were mostly discovered by Shulgin himself. For each substance there is information on its synthesis, suggested effective dosage, duration, and detailed commentary on the subjective effects that were experienced. This book appeals to adults of all ages and cultures, and to the psychedelically experienced and inexperienced alike.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e", "custom_clean": 1, "custom_lists": [], "custom_lists_ids": null, "custom_read_date": null, "custom_reading_list": 1, "custom_types": "eBook", "flags": 1, "has_cover": 1, "id": 252, "identifier_ids": "864,865,863", "identifiers": [{"book": 252, "id": 863, "name": "ISBN", "path": "https://www.worldcat.org/isbn/9780963009609", "sort": "isbn", "type": "isbn", "val": "9780963009609"}, {"book": 252, "id": 865, "name": "Google Books", "path": "https://books.google.com/books?id=O8AdHBGybpcC", "sort": "google", "type": "google", "val": "O8AdHBGybpcC"}, {"book": 252, "id": 864, "name": "Goodreads", "path": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/886113", "sort": "goodreads", "type": "goodreads", "val": "886113"}], "isbn": "9780963009609", "language_ids": "1", "languages": [{"avg_rating": 8.429245283018869, "count": 341, "id": 1, "name": "ENG", "sort": "ENG"}], "last_modified": "2023-03-25 22:02:03.254144+00:00", "order_by": "2023-01-03 18:10:07.521546+00:00", "path": "Alexander Shulgin/Pihkal_ A Chemical Love Story (252)", "pubdate": "1990-10-01", "publisher_ids": "153", "publishers": [{"avg_rating": 8.0, "count": 1, "id": 153, "name": "Transform Press", "sort": "Transform Press"}], "rating": 4, "series": [], "series_ids": null, "size": 1271874, "tag_ids": "43,92,239,241,242", "tags": [{"avg_rating": 8.222222222222221, "count": 31, "id": 92, "name": "Biography", "sort": 31}, {"avg_rating": 8.0, "count": 27, "id": 43, "name": "Self Help", "sort": 27}, {"avg_rating": 8.0, "count": 1, "id": 239, "name": "Personal Memoirs", "sort": 1}, {"avg_rating": 8.0, "count": 1, "id": 241, "name": "Substance Abuse \u0026 Addictions", "sort": 1}, {"avg_rating": 8.0, "count": 1, "id": 242, "name": "Drugs", "sort": 1}], "timestamp": "2023-01-03 18:10:07.521546+00:00", "title": "Pihkal: A Chemical Love Story"}, {"author_ids": "335", "authors": [{"avg_rating": 8.0, "count": 1, "id": 335, "name": "Tony Fadell", "sort": "Fadell, Tony"}], "comments": "\u003cdiv\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWritten for anyone who wants to grow at work\u2014from young grads navigating their first jobs to CEOs deciding whether to sell their company\u2014 Build is full of personal stories, practical advice and fascinating insights into some of the most impactful products and people of the 20th century.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEach quick 5-20 page entry builds on the previous one, charting Tony\u2019s personal journey from a product designer to a leader, from a startup founder to an executive to a mentor.

These models have obtained state-of-the-art results on datasets and tasks where large training sets are available. However, they do not transfer well to new applications with no training data, and are outperformed by unsupervised term-frequency methods such as BM25. In this work, we explore the limits of contrastive learning as a way to train unsupervised dense retrievers and show that it leads to strong performance in various retrieval settings. On the BEIR benchmark our unsupervised model outperforms BM25 on 11 out of 15 datasets for the Recall@100. When used as pre-training before fine-tuning, either on a few thousands in-domain examples or on the large MS~MARCO dataset, our contrastive model leads to improvements on the BEIR benchmark. Finally, we evaluate our approach for multi-lingual retrieval, where training data is even scarcer than for English, and show that our approach leads to strong unsupervised performance. Our model also exhibits strong cross-lingual transfer when fine-tuned on supervised English data only and evaluated on low resources language such as Swahili. We show that our unsupervised models can perform cross-lingual retrieval between different scripts, such as retrieving English documents from Arabic queries, which would not be possible with term matching methods.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e", "custom_clean": 1, "custom_lists": [{"id": 3, "sort": "Machine Learning.Deep Learning", "value": "Machine Learning.Deep Learning"}], "custom_lists_ids": "3", "custom_read_date": null, "custom_reading_list": 1, "custom_types": "Paper", "flags": 1, "has_cover": 1, "id": 247, "identifier_ids": "927", "identifiers": [{"book": 247, "id": 927, "name": "arXiv", "path": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.09118", "sort": "arxiv", "type": "arxiv", "val": "2112.09118"}], "isbn": null, "language_ids": "1", "languages": [{"avg_rating": 8.429245283018869, "count": 341, "id": 1, "name": "ENG", "sort": "ENG"}], "last_modified": "2023-03-16 22:08:36.421370+00:00", "order_by": "2022-12-05 19:21:52.360004+00:00", "path": "Gautier Izacard/Unsupervised Dense Information Retr (247)", "pubdate": "2022-12-05", "publisher_ids": "125", "publishers": [{"avg_rating": null, "count": 9, "id": 125, "name": "arXiv", "sort": "arXiv"}], "rating": null, "series": [], "series_ids": null, "size": 686136, "tag_ids": "186,189,191,237", "tags": [{"avg_rating": 7.857142857142857, "count": 28, "id": 191, "name": "Computer Science", "sort": 28}, {"avg_rating": null, "count": 11, "id": 189, "name": "Deep Learning", "sort": 11}, {"avg_rating": null, "count": 10, "id": 186, "name": "Machine Learning", "sort": 10}, {"avg_rating": null, "count": 1, "id": 237, "name": "Information Retrieval", "sort": 1}], "timestamp": "2022-12-05 19:21:52.360004+00:00", "title": "Unsupervised Dense Information Retrieval with Contrastive Learning"}, {"author_ids": "301,320,321,322,323", "authors": [{"avg_rating": null, "count": 1, "id": 320, "name": "Eric Breck", "sort": "Breck, Eric"}, {"avg_rating": null, "count": 1, "id": 321, "name": "Shanqing Cai", "sort": "Cai, Shanqing"}, {"avg_rating": null, "count": 1, "id": 322, "name": "Eric Nielsen", "sort": "Nielsen, Eric"}, {"avg_rating": null, "count": 1, "id": 323, "name": "Michael Salib", "sort": "Salib, Michael"}, {"avg_rating": null, "count": 2, "id": 301, "name": "D.

This goal has forced organizations to evolve their development processes. We report on a study that we conducted on observing software teams at Microsoft as they develop AI-based applications. We consider a nine-stage workflow process informed by prior experiences developing AI applications (e.g., search and NLP) and data science tools (e.g. application diagnostics and bug reporting). We found that various Microsoft teams have united this workflow into preexisting, well-evolved, Agile-like software engineering processes, providing insights about several essential engineering challenges that organizations may face in creating large-scale AI solutions for the marketplace. We collected some best practices from Microsoft teams to address these challenges. In addition, we have identified three aspects of the AI domain that make it fundamentally different from prior software application domains: 1) discovering, managing, and versioning the data needed for machine learning applications is much more complex and difficult than other types of software engineering, 2) model customization and model reuse require very different skills than are typically found in software teams, and 3) AI components are more difficult to handle as distinct modules than traditional software components - models may be \"entangled\" in complex ways and experience non-monotonic error behavior.

Our intuition is simple: learn what the world looks like and how it is described from paired text-image data, and learn how the world moves from unsupervised video footage. Make-A-Video has three advantages: (1) it accelerates training of the T2V model (it does not need to learn visual and multimodal representations from scratch), (2) it does not require paired text-video data, and (3) the generated videos inherit the vastness (diversity in aesthetic, fantastical depictions, etc.) of today\u0027s image generation models. We design a simple yet effective way to build on T2I models with novel and effective spatial-temporal modules. First, we decompose the full temporal U-Net and attention tensors and approximate them in space and time. Second, we design a spatial temporal pipeline to generate high resolution and frame rate videos with a video decoder, interpolation model and two super resolution models that can enable various applications besides T2V. In all aspects, spatial and temporal resolution, faithfulness to text, and quality, Make-A-Video sets the new state-of-the-art in text-to-video generation, as determined by both qualitative and quantitative measures.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e", "custom_clean": 1, "custom_lists": [{"id": 3, "sort": "Machine Learning.Deep Learning", "value": "Machine Learning.Deep Learning"}], "custom_lists_ids": "3", "custom_read_date": "2022-10-06", "custom_reading_list": 0, "custom_types": "Paper", "flags": 1, "has_cover": 1, "id": 202, "identifier_ids": "726", "identifiers": [{"book": 202, "id": 726, "name": "arXiv", "path": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.14792", "sort": "arxiv", "type": "arxiv", "val": "2209.14792"}], "isbn": null, "language_ids": "1", "languages": [{"avg_rating": 8.429245283018869, "count": 341, "id": 1, "name": "ENG", "sort": "ENG"}], "last_modified": "2023-01-27 19:20:40.603931+00:00", "order_by": "2022-10-15 12:36:28+00:00", "path": "Uriel Singer/Make-A-Video_ Text-to-Video Generat (202)", "pubdate": "2022-09-29", "publisher_ids": "125", "publishers": [{"avg_rating": null, "count": 9, "id": 125, "name": "arXiv", "sort": "arXiv"}], "rating": null, "series": [], "series_ids": null, "size": 14464869, "tag_ids": "186,189,191,192", "tags": [{"avg_rating": 7.857142857142857, "count": 28, "id": 191, "name": "Computer Science", "sort": 28}, {"avg_rating": null, "count": 11, "id": 189, "name": "Deep Learning", "sort": 11}, {"avg_rating": null, "count": 10, "id": 186, "name": "Machine Learning", "sort": 10}, {"avg_rating": null, "count": 2, "id": 192, "name": "Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition", "sort": 2}], "timestamp": "2022-10-15 12:36:28+00:00", "title": "Make-A-Video: Text-to-Video Generation without Text-Video Data"}, {"author_ids": "292,293,294,295,296,297,298,299", "authors": [{"avg_rating": null, "count": 1, "id": 297, "name": "Aidan N.

We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer, based solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely. Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.8 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature.

In order to clarify the intended use cases of machine learning models and minimize their usage in contexts for which they are not well suited, we recommend that released models be accompanied by documentation detailing their performance characteristics. In this paper, we propose a framework that we call model cards, to encourage such transparent model reporting. Model cards are short documents accompanying trained machine learning models that provide benchmarked evaluation in a variety of conditions, such as across different cultural, demographic, or phenotypic groups (e.g., race, geographic location, sex, Fitzpatrick skin type) and intersectional groups (e.g., age and race, or sex and Fitzpatrick skin type) that are relevant to the intended application domains. Model cards also disclose the context in which models are intended to be used, details of the performance evaluation procedures, and other relevant information. While we focus primarily on human-centered machine learning models in the application fields of computer vision and natural language processing, this framework can be used to document any trained machine learning model. To solidify the concept, we provide cards for two supervised models: One trained to detect smiling faces in images, and one trained to detect toxic comments in text. We propose model cards as a step towards the responsible democratization of machine learning and related AI technology, increasing transparency into how well AI technology works.

Scott Fitzgerald that follows a cast of characters living in the fictional town of West Egg on prosperous Long Island in the summer of 1922. The story primarily concerns the young and mysterious millionaire Jay Gatsby and his quixotic passion and obsession for the beautiful former debutante Daisy Buchanan. Considered to be Fitzgerald\u0027s magnum opus, The Great Gatsby explores themes of decadence, idealism, resistance to change, social upheaval, and excess, creating a portrait of the Jazz Age or the Roaring Twenties that has been described as a cautionary tale regarding the American Dream. Fitzgerald-inspired by the parties he had attended while visiting Long Island\u0027s north shore-began planning the novel in 1923, desiring to produce, in his words, \"something new-something extraordinary and beautiful and simple and intricately patterned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\" Progress was slow, with Fitzgerald completing his first draft following a move to the French Riviera in 1924. His editor, Maxwell Perkins, felt the book was vague and persuaded the author to revise over the next winter. Fitzgerald was repeatedly ambivalent about the book\u0027s title and he considered a variety of alternatives, including titles that referenced the Roman character Trimalchio; the title he was last documented to have desired was Under the Red, White, and Blue. In its first year, the book sold only 20,000 copies. Fitzgerald died in 1940, believing himself to be a failure and his work forgotten. However, the novel experienced a revival during World War II, and became a part of American high school curricula and numerous stage and film adaptations in the following decades. Today, The Great Gatsby is widely considered to be a literary classic and a contender for the title \"Great American Novel\". In 1998, the Modern Library editorial board voted it the 20th century\u0027s best American novel and second best English-language novel of the same time period.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e", "custom_clean": 1, "custom_lists": [{"id": 6, "sort": "Must Read.10 Greatest Books of All Time", "value": "Must Read.10 Greatest Books of All Time"}, {"id": 7, "sort": "Gutenberg Collection", "value": "Gutenberg Collection"}], "custom_lists_ids": "6,7", "custom_read_date": null, "custom_reading_list": 0, "custom_types": "eBook", "flags": 1, "has_cover": 1, "id": 211, "identifier_ids": "771,768,769,770", "identifiers": [{"book": 211, "id": 770, "name": "ISBN", "path": "https://www.worldcat.org/isbn/9789176371213", "sort": "isbn", "type": "isbn", "val": "9789176371213"}, {"book": 211, "id": 769, "name": "Gutenberg", "path": "http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/64317", "sort": "gutenberg", "type": "gutenberg", "val": "64317"}, {"book": 211, "id": 768, "name": "Google Books", "path": "https://books.google.com/books?id=u-OCjwEACAAJ", "sort": "google", "type": "google", "val": "u-OCjwEACAAJ"}, {"book": 211, "id": 771, "name": "Goodreads", "path": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28787401", "sort": "goodreads", "type": "goodreads", "val": "28787401"}], "isbn": "9789176371213", "language_ids": "1", "languages": [{"avg_rating": 8.429245283018869, "count": 341, "id": 1, "name": "ENG", "sort": "ENG"}], "last_modified": "2023-05-04 17:55:52.136675+00:00", "order_by": "2022-10-10 14:39:37.098030+00:00", "path": "F.

However, these models lack the ability to mimic the appearance of subjects in a given reference set and synthesize novel renditions of them in different contexts. In this work, we present a new approach for \"personalization\" of text-to-image diffusion models (specializing them to users\u0027 needs). Given as input just a few images of a subject, we fine-tune a pretrained text-to-image model (Imagen, although our method is not limited to a specific model) such that it learns to bind a unique identifier with that specific subject. Once the subject is embedded in the output domain of the model, the unique identifier can then be used to synthesize fully-novel photorealistic images of the subject contextualized in different scenes. By leveraging the semantic prior embedded in the model with a new autogenous class-specific prior preservation loss, our technique enables synthesizing the subject in diverse scenes, poses, views, and lighting conditions that do not appear in the reference images. We apply our technique to several previously-unassailable tasks, including subject recontextualization, text-guided view synthesis, appearance modification, and artistic rendering (all while preserving the subject\u0027s key features).\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e", "custom_clean": 1, "custom_lists": [{"id": 3, "sort": "Machine Learning.Deep Learning", "value": "Machine Learning.Deep Learning"}], "custom_lists_ids": "3", "custom_read_date": "2022-08-17", "custom_reading_list": 0, "custom_types": "Paper", "flags": 1, "has_cover": 1, "id": 201, "identifier_ids": "724", "identifiers": [{"book": 201, "id": 724, "name": "arXiv", "path": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.12242", "sort": "arxiv", "type": "arxiv", "val": "2208.12242"}], "isbn": null, "language_ids": "1", "languages": [{"avg_rating": 8.429245283018869, "count": 341, "id": 1, "name": "ENG", "sort": "ENG"}], "last_modified": "2022-10-19 08:42:27.829507+00:00", "order_by": "2022-10-10 10:33:15+00:00", "path": "Nataniel Ruiz/DreamBooth Fine Tuning T2I Diffusio (201)", "pubdate": "2022-08-25", "publisher_ids": "125", "publishers": [{"avg_rating": null, "count": 9, "id": 125, "name": "arXiv", "sort": "arXiv"}], "rating": null, "series": [], "series_ids": null, "size": 17258364, "tag_ids": "188,189,191,192", "tags": [{"avg_rating": 7.857142857142857, "count": 28, "id": 191, "name": "Computer Science", "sort": 28}, {"avg_rating": null, "count": 11, "id": 189, "name": "Deep Learning", "sort": 11}, {"avg_rating": null, "count": 2, "id": 188, "name": "Paper", "sort": 2}, {"avg_rating": null, "count": 2, "id": 192, "name": "Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition", "sort": 2}], "timestamp": "2022-10-10 10:33:15+00:00", "title": "DreamBooth Fine Tuning T2I Diffusion Models for Subject Driven Generation"}, {"author_ids": "262", "authors": [{"avg_rating": 6.0, "count": 1, "id": 262, "name": "Lazy Programmer", "sort": "Programmer, Lazy"}], "comments": "\u003cdiv\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDeep learning is making waves.

Instead, we will let the neural network learn these things for us. Each layer of the neural network learns a different abstraction than the previous layers. For example, in image classification, the first layer might learn different strokes, and in the next layer put the strokes together to learn shapes, and in the next layer put the shapes together to form facial features, and in the next layer have a high level representation of faces.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn top of all this, deep learning is known for winning its fair share Kaggle contests.

Years later, he would put his lexical bent to work by inventing Newspeak, and draw on his down-and-out experience to evoke the plight of the Proles in 1984. Though marred by hints of unexamined anti-Semitism, Orwell\u0027s debut remains, as The Nation put it, \"the most lucid portrait of poverty in the English language.\" --Tim Appelo\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e", "custom_clean": 1, "custom_lists": [], "custom_lists_ids": null, "custom_read_date": null, "custom_reading_list": 0, "custom_types": "eBook", "flags": 1, "has_cover": 1, "id": 159, "identifier_ids": "483,484,481,482", "identifiers": [{"book": 159, "id": 482, "name": "ISBN", "path": "https://www.worldcat.org/isbn/9780156262248", "sort": "isbn", "type": "isbn", "val": "9780156262248"}, {"book": 159, "id": 481, "name": "Google Books", "path": "https://books.google.com/books?id=m5vIVN7LjtgC", "sort": "google", "type": "google", "val": "m5vIVN7LjtgC"}, {"book": 159, "id": 484, "name": "Goodreads", "path": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34304872", "sort": "goodreads", "type": "goodreads", "val": "34304872"}, {"book": 159, "id": 483, "name": "Amazon", "path": "https://amazon.com/dp/015626224X", "sort": "amazon", "type": "amazon", "val": "015626224X"}], "isbn": "9780156262248", "language_ids": "1", "languages": [{"avg_rating": 8.429245283018869, "count": 341, "id": 1, "name": "ENG", "sort": "ENG"}], "last_modified": "2023-05-04 17:55:52.136675+00:00", "order_by": "2022-10-06 09:35:53.313990+00:00", "path": "George Orwell/Down and Out in Paris and London (159)", "pubdate": "1933-01-01", "publisher_ids": "90", "publishers": [{"avg_rating": 8.8, "count": 20, "id": 90, "name": "Penguin Random House", "sort": "Penguin Random House"}], "rating": 4, "series": [], "series_ids": null, "size": 690052, "tag_ids": "57,60,90,92,153", "tags": [{"avg_rating": 8.222222222222221, "count": 31, "id": 92, "name": "Biography", "sort": 31}, {"avg_rating": 8.578947368421053, "count": 28, "id": 153, "name": "Classics", "sort": 28}, {"avg_rating": 8.363636363636363, "count": 24, "id": 60, "name": "History", "sort": 24}, {"avg_rating": 8.347826086956522, "count": 23, "id": 57, "name": "Politics", "sort": 23}, {"avg_rating": 7.5, "count": 4, "id": 90, "name": "Travel", "sort": 4}], "timestamp": "2022-10-06 09:35:53.313990+00:00", "title": "Down and Out in Paris and London"}, {"author_ids": "166", "authors": [{"avg_rating": 8.0, "count": 1, "id": 166, "name": "John Kennedy Toole", "sort": "Toole, John Kennedy"}], "comments": "\u003cdiv\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReleased by Louisiana State University Press in 1980, A Confederacy of Dunces is nothing short of a publishing phenomenon.

Today there are almost two million copies in print worldwide in eighteen languages. Now, for the first time, John Kennedy Toole\u0027s comic masterpiece is available in a large print edition.

As its characters burst into life, they leave the region and literature forever changed by their presence -- Ignatius and his mother; Miss Trixie, the octogenarian assistant accountant at Levi Pants; inept, wan Patrolman Mancuso; Darlene, the Bourbon Street stripper with a penchant for poultry; Jones the jivecat in spaceage dark glasses.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIncluded here is the introduction that writer and New Orleans resident Andrei Codrescu composed for the book\u0027s twentieth anniversary.

Sullivan, Jr., Washington Post From one of our top historians, a groundbreaking story of policing and \u201criots\u201d that shatters our understanding of the post\u2013civil rights era. What began in spring 2020 as local protests in response to the killing of George Floyd by Minneapolis police quickly exploded into a massive nationwide movement. Millions of mostly young people defiantly flooded into the nation\u2019s streets, demanding an end to police brutality and to the broader, systemic repression of Black people and other people of color. To many observers, the protests appeared to be without precedent in their scale and persistence. Yet, as the acclaimed historian Elizabeth Hinton demonstrates in America on Fire, the events of 2020 had clear precursors\u2014and any attempt to understand our current crisis requires a reckoning with the recent past. Even in the aftermath of Donald Trump, many Americans consider the decades since the civil rights movement in the mid-1960s as a story of progress toward greater inclusiveness and equality. Hinton\u2019s sweeping narrative uncovers an altogether different history, taking us on a troubling journey from Detroit in 1967 and Miami in 1980 to Los Angeles in 1992 and beyond to chart the persistence of structural racism and one of its primary consequences, the so-called urban riot. Hinton offers a critical corrective: the word riot was nothing less than a racist trope applied to events that can only be properly understood as rebellions\u2014explosions of collective resistance to an unequal and violent order. As she suggests, if rebellion and the conditions that precipitated it never disappeared, the optimistic story of a post\u2013Jim Crow United States no longer holds. Black rebellion, America on Fire powerfully illustrates, was born in response to poverty and exclusion, but most immediately in reaction to police violence. In 1968, President Lyndon Johnson launched the \u201cWar on Crime,\u201d sending militarized police forces into impoverished Black neighborhoods. Facing increasing surveillance and brutality, residents threw rocks and Molotov cocktails at officers, plundered local businesses, and vandalized exploitative institutions. Hinton draws on exclusive sources to uncover a previously hidden geography of violence in smaller American cities, from York, Pennsylvania, to Cairo, Illinois, to Stockton, California. The central lesson from these eruptions\u2014that police violence invariably leads to community violence\u2014continues to escape policymakers, who respond by further criminalizing entire groups instead of addressing underlying socioeconomic causes. The results are the hugely expanded policing and prison regimes that shape the lives of so many Americans today. Presenting a new framework for understanding our nation\u2019s enduring strife, America on Fire is also a warning: rebellions will surely continue unless police are no longer called on to manage the consequences of dismal conditions beyond their control, and until an oppressive system is finally remade on the principles of justice and equality.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e", "custom_clean": 1, "custom_lists": [{"id": 5, "sort": "Must Read.2021 Time", "value": "Must Read.2021 Time"}], "custom_lists_ids": "5", "custom_read_date": null, "custom_reading_list": 0, "custom_types": "eBook", "flags": 1, "has_cover": 1, "id": 144, "identifier_ids": "351,352,353", "identifiers": [{"book": 144, "id": 353, "name": "ISBN", "path": "https://www.worldcat.org/isbn/9781631498916", "sort": "isbn", "type": "isbn", "val": "9781631498916"}, {"book": 144, "id": 352, "name": "Google Books", "path": "https://books.google.com/books?id=PAwDEAAAQBAJ", "sort": "google", "type": "google", "val": "PAwDEAAAQBAJ"}, {"book": 144, "id": 351, "name": "Goodreads", "path": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/55298326", "sort": "goodreads", "type": "goodreads", "val": "55298326"}], "isbn": "9781631498916", "language_ids": "1", "languages": [{"avg_rating": 8.429245283018869, "count": 341, "id": 1, "name": "ENG", "sort": "ENG"}], "last_modified": "2023-05-04 17:55:52.136675+00:00", "order_by": "2022-10-05 15:54:15.142378+00:00", "path": "Elizabeth Hinton/America on Fire_ The Untold History (144)", "pubdate": "2021-05-18", "publisher_ids": "84", "publishers": [{"avg_rating": 8.0, "count": 4, "id": 84, "name": "Liveright Publishing", "sort": "Liveright Publishing"}], "rating": 4, "series": [], "series_ids": null, "size": 12900649, "tag_ids": "57,60,194", "tags": [{"avg_rating": 8.333333333333334, "count": 40, "id": 194, "name": "Time", "sort": 40}, {"avg_rating": 8.363636363636363, "count": 24, "id": 60, "name": "History", "sort": 24}, {"avg_rating": 8.347826086956522, "count": 23, "id": 57, "name": "Politics", "sort": 23}], "timestamp": "2022-10-05 15:54:15.142378+00:00", "title": "America on Fire: The Untold History of Police Violence and Black Rebellion Since the 1960s"}, {"author_ids": "145", "authors": [{"avg_rating": 8.0, "count": 1, "id": 145, "name": "Elizabeth Kolbert", "sort": "Kolbert, Elizabeth"}], "comments": "\u003cdiv\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNATIONAL BESTSELLER * The Pulitzer Prize-winning author of The Sixth Extinction returns to humanity\u0027s transformative impact on the environment, now asking: After doing so much damage, can we change nature, this time to save it?

So pervasive are human impacts on the planet that it\u0027s said we live in a new geological epoch: the Anthropocene. In Under a White Sky, Elizabeth Kolbert takes a hard look at the new world we are creating. Along the way, she meets biologists who are trying to preserve the world\u0027s rarest fish, which lives in a single tiny pool in the middle of the Mojave; engineers who are turning carbon emissions to stone in Iceland; Australian researchers who are trying to develop a \"super coral\" that can survive on a hotter globe; and physicists who are contemplating shooting tiny diamonds into the stratosphere to cool the earth. One way to look at human civilization, says Kolbert, is as a ten-thousand-year exercise in defying nature. In The Sixth Extinction, she explored the ways in which our capacity for destruction has reshaped the natural world. Now she examines how the very sorts of interventions that have imperiled our planet are increasingly seen as the only hope for its salvation. By turns inspiring, terrifying, and darkly comic, Under a White Sky is an utterly original examination of the challenges we face.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e", "custom_clean": 1, "custom_lists": [{"id": 5, "sort": "Must Read.2021 Time", "value": "Must Read.2021 Time"}], "custom_lists_ids": "5", "custom_read_date": null, "custom_reading_list": 0, "custom_types": "eBook", "flags": 1, "has_cover": 1, "id": 143, "identifier_ids": "462,461,460,459", "identifiers": [{"book": 143, "id": 459, "name": "ISBN", "path": "https://www.worldcat.org/isbn/9780593136287", "sort": "isbn", "type": "isbn", "val": "9780593136287"}, {"book": 143, "id": 460, "name": "Google Books", "path": "https://books.google.com/books?id=qwpjEAAAQBAJ", "sort": "google", "type": "google", "val": "qwpjEAAAQBAJ"}, {"book": 143, "id": 461, "name": "Goodreads", "path": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/60757903", "sort": "goodreads", "type": "goodreads", "val": "60757903"}, {"book": 143, "id": 462, "name": "Amazon", "path": "https://amazon.com/dp/B08DMWR6BP", "sort": "amazon", "type": "amazon", "val": "B08DMWR6BP"}], "isbn": "9780593136287", "language_ids": "1", "languages": [{"avg_rating": 8.429245283018869, "count": 341, "id": 1, "name": "ENG", "sort": "ENG"}], "last_modified": "2023-05-04 17:55:52.136675+00:00", "order_by": "2022-10-05 15:54:14.761371+00:00", "path": "Elizabeth Kolbert/Under a White Sky_ The Nature of th (143)", "pubdate": "2021-02-09", "publisher_ids": "100", "publishers": [{"avg_rating": 8.0, "count": 6, "id": 100, "name": "Crown Publishing Group", "sort": "Crown Publishing Group"}], "rating": 4, "series": [], "series_ids": null, "size": 4317039, "tag_ids": "57,58,60,125,194,253", "tags": [{"avg_rating": 8.333333333333334, "count": 40, "id": 194, "name": "Time", "sort": 40}, {"avg_rating": 8.363636363636363, "count": 24, "id": 60, "name": "History", "sort": 24}, {"avg_rating": 8.347826086956522, "count": 23, "id": 57, "name": "Politics", "sort": 23}, {"avg_rating": 8.222222222222221, "count": 11, "id": 58, "name": "Science", "sort": 11}, {"avg_rating": 8.0, "count": 2, "id": 253, "name": "Non-Fiction", "sort": 2}, {"avg_rating": 8.0, "count": 1, "id": 125, "name": "Climate Crisis", "sort": 1}], "timestamp": "2022-10-05 15:54:14.761371+00:00", "title": "Under a White Sky: The Nature of the Future"}, {"author_ids": "144", "authors": [{"avg_rating": 8.0, "count": 1, "id": 144, "name": "Gabriel Krauze", "sort": "Krauze, Gabriel"}], "comments": "\u003cdiv\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLonglisted for the Booker Prize 2020 A Spectator Book of the Year \u0027A literary rendering of the Top Boy generation...

Nobody, including the lawmakers who passed the bill, expected it to transform the country\u2019s demographics. But over the next four decades, millions arrived, including Jay Caspian Kang\u2019s parents, grandparents, aunts, and uncles. They came with almost no understanding of their new home, much less the history of \u201cAsian America\u201d that was supposed to define them.\u00a0The Loneliest Americans is the unforgettable story of Kang and his family as they move from a housing project in Cambridge to an idyllic college town in the South and eventually to the West Coast.

Pop Song is a book about love and about falling in love\u2014with a place, or a painting, or a person\u2014and the joy and terror inherent in the experience of that love. Plumbing the well of culture for clues and patterns about love and loss\u2014from Agnes Martin\u0027s abstract paintings to James Turrell\u0027s transcendent light works, and Anne Carson\u0027s Eros the Bittersweet to Frank Ocean\u0027s Blonde\u2014Pham writes of her youthful attempts to find meaning in travel, sex, drugs, and art, before sensing that she might need to turn her gaze upon herself. Pop Song is also a book about distances, near and far. As she travels from Taos, New Mexico, to Shanghai, China and beyond, Pham meditates on the miles we are willing to cover to get away from ourselves, or those who hurt us, and the impossible gaps that can exist between two people sharing a bed. Pop Song is a book about all the routes by which we might escape our own needs before finally finding a way home. There is heartache in these pages, but Pham\u0027s electric ways of seeing create a perfectly fractured portrait of modern intimacy that is triumphant in both its vulnerability and restlessness. \"Each of the essays in this debut collection reads like a mini-memoir ... in which the author reflects on her experiences of young love, trauma, and transcendence through discussions of art and music ... with an intimacy that is at once tender and expansive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\" \u2014New York magazine\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e", "custom_clean": 1, "custom_lists": [{"id": 5, "sort": "Must Read.2021 Time", "value": "Must Read.2021 Time"}], "custom_lists_ids": "5", "custom_read_date": null, "custom_reading_list": 0, "custom_types": "eBook", "flags": 1, "has_cover": 1, "id": 133, "identifier_ids": "320,318,319", "identifiers": [{"book": 133, "id": 319, "name": "ISBN", "path": "https://www.worldcat.org/isbn/9781646220274", "sort": "isbn", "type": "isbn", "val": "9781646220274"}, {"book": 133, "id": 318, "name": "Google Books", "path": "https://books.google.com/books?id=V6UQEAAAQBAJ", "sort": "google", "type": "google", "val": "V6UQEAAAQBAJ"}, {"book": 133, "id": 320, "name": "Goodreads", "path": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/60057391", "sort": "goodreads", "type": "goodreads", "val": "60057391"}], "isbn": "9781646220274", "language_ids": "1", "languages": [{"avg_rating": 8.429245283018869, "count": 341, "id": 1, "name": "ENG", "sort": "ENG"}], "last_modified": "2023-05-04 17:55:52.136675+00:00", "order_by": "2022-10-05 15:54:11.131714+00:00", "path": "Larissa Pham/Pop Song_ Adventures in Art \u0026 Intim (133)", "pubdate": "2021-05-04", "publisher_ids": "77", "publishers": [{"avg_rating": 8.0, "count": 1, "id": 77, "name": "Catapult", "sort": "Catapult"}], "rating": 4, "series": [], "series_ids": null, "size": 1035488, "tag_ids": "44,49,92,132,133,194", "tags": [{"avg_rating": 8.89655172413793, "count": 51, "id": 49, "name": "Contemporary", "sort": 51}, {"avg_rating": 8.333333333333334, "count": 40, "id": 194, "name": "Time", "sort": 40}, {"avg_rating": 8.222222222222221, "count": 31, "id": 92, "name": "Biography", "sort": 31}, {"avg_rating": 8.0, "count": 6, "id": 44, "name": "Art", "sort": 6}, {"avg_rating": 7.6, "count": 6, "id": 132, "name": "Music", "sort": 6}, {"avg_rating": 8.333333333333334, "count": 6, "id": 133, "name": "Feminism", "sort": 6}], "timestamp": "2022-10-05 15:54:11.131714+00:00", "title": "Pop Song: Adventures in Art \u0026 Intimacy"}, {"author_ids": "134", "authors": [{"avg_rating": 8.0, "count": 1, "id": 134, "name": "Louis Menand", "sort": "Menand, Louis"}], "comments": "\u003cdiv\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"An engrossing and impossibly wide-ranging project ...

It was also about ideas, in the broadest sense\u2014economic and political, artistic and personal. In The Free World, the acclaimed Pulitzer Prize\u2013winning scholar and critic Louis Menand tells the story of American culture in the pivotal years from the end of World War II to Vietnam and shows how changing economic, technological, and social forces put their mark on creations of the mind. How did elitism and an anti-totalitarian skepticism of passion and ideology give way to a new sensibility defined by freewheeling experimentation and loving the Beatles? How was the ideal of \u201cfreedom\u201d applied to causes that ranged from anti-communism and civil rights to radical acts of self-creation via art and even crime? With the wit and insight familiar to readers of The Metaphysical Club and his New Yorker essays, Menand takes us inside Hannah Arendt\u2019s Manhattan, the Paris of Jean-Paul Sartre and Simone de Beauvoir, Merce Cunningham and John Cage\u2019s residencies at North Carolina\u2019s Black Mountain College, and the Memphis studio where Sam Phillips and Elvis Presley created a new music for the American teenager. He examines the post war vogue for French existentialism, structuralism and post-structuralism, the rise of abstract expressionism and pop art, Allen Ginsberg\u2019s friendship with Lionel Trilling, James Baldwin\u2019s transformation into a Civil Right spokesman, Susan Sontag\u2019s challenges to the New York Intellectuals, the defeat of obscenity laws, and the rise of the New Hollywood. Stressing the rich flow of ideas across the Atlantic, he also shows how Europeans played a vital role in promoting and influencing American art and entertainment. By the end of the Vietnam era, the American government had lost the moral prestige it enjoyed at the end of the Second World War, but America\u2019s once-despised culture had become respected and adored.

Next he directed four consecutive hit plays, won back-to-back Tonys, ushered in a new era of Hollywood moviemaking with Who\u0027s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?, and followed it with The Graduate, which won him an Oscar and became the third-highest-grossing movie ever.

It would take decades for him to come to grips with his demons. In an incomparable portrait that follows Nichols from Berlin to New York to Chicago to Hollywood, Mark Harris explores, with brilliantly vivid detail and insight, the life, work, struggle, and passion of an artist and man in constant motion. Among the 250 people Harris interviewed: Elaine May, Meryl Streep, Stephen Sondheim, Robert Redford, Glenn Close, Tom Hanks, Candice Bergen, Emma Thompson, Annette Bening, Natalie Portman, Julia Roberts, Lorne Michaels, and Gloria Steinem.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMark Harris gives an intimate and evenhanded accounting of success and failure alike; the portrait is not always flattering, but its ultimate impact is to present the full story of one of the most richly interesting, complicated, and consequential figures the worlds of theater and motion pictures have ever seen.

With these and other ruptures, Nadia arrived in New York as a young woman feeling stateless, motherless, and uncertain about her future, yet eager to find her own identity. What followed, however, were periods of depression in which she struggled to hold herself and her siblings together. \u201cA magnificent, complex assessment of selfhood and why it matters\u201d (Elle), Aftershocks depicts the way she hauled herself from the wreckage of her life\u2019s perpetual quaking, the means by which she has finally come to understand that the only ground firm enough to count on is the one written into existence by her own hand. \u201cFull of narrative risk and untrammeled lyricism\u201d (The Washington Post), Aftershocks joins the likes of Don\u2019t Let\u2019s Go to the Dogs Tonight and William Styron\u2019s Darkness Visible, and does for race identity what Maggie Nelson does for gender identity in The Argonauts.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e", "custom_clean": 1, "custom_lists": [{"id": 5, "sort": "Must Read.2021 Time", "value": "Must Read.2021 Time"}], "custom_lists_ids": "5", "custom_read_date": null, "custom_reading_list": 0, "custom_types": "eBook", "flags": 1, "has_cover": 1, "id": 127, "identifier_ids": "415,416", "identifiers": [{"book": 127, "id": 416, "name": "ISBN", "path": "https://www.worldcat.org/isbn/9781982111236", "sort": "isbn", "type": "isbn", "val": "9781982111236"}, {"book": 127, "id": 415, "name": "Google Books", "path": "https://books.google.com/books?id=VBQ3EAAAQBAJ", "sort": "google", "type": "google", "val": "VBQ3EAAAQBAJ"}], "isbn": "9781982111236", "language_ids": "1", "languages": [{"avg_rating": 8.429245283018869, "count": 341, "id": 1, "name": "ENG", "sort": "ENG"}], "last_modified": "2023-05-04 17:55:52.136675+00:00", "order_by": "2022-10-05 15:54:08.709178+00:00", "path": "Nadia Owusu/Aftershocks_ A Memoir (127)", "pubdate": "2021-08-03", "publisher_ids": "22", "publishers": [{"avg_rating": 8.0, "count": 8, "id": 22, "name": "Simon \u0026 Schuster", "sort": "Simon \u0026 Schuster"}], "rating": null, "series": [], "series_ids": null, "size": 3951047, "tag_ids": "92,119,120,150,194,331", "tags": [{"avg_rating": 8.333333333333334, "count": 40, "id": 194, "name": "Time", "sort": 40}, {"avg_rating": 8.222222222222221, "count": 31, "id": 92, "name": "Biography", "sort": 31}, {"avg_rating": 10.0, "count": 5, "id": 331, "name": "Girls \u0026 Women", "sort": 5}, {"avg_rating": 10.0, "count": 2, "id": 119, "name": "Ethnic \u0026 Regional", "sort": 2}, {"avg_rating": 10.0, "count": 2, "id": 120, "name": "African American \u0026 Black", "sort": 2}, {"avg_rating": null, "count": 1, "id": 150, "name": "Cultural", "sort": 1}], "timestamp": "2022-10-05 15:54:08.709178+00:00", "title": "Aftershocks: A Memoir"}, {"author_ids": "128", "authors": [{"avg_rating": 8.0, "count": 1, "id": 128, "name": "Nicole Eustace", "sort": "Eustace, Nicole"}], "comments": "\u003cdiv\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the eve of a major treaty conference between Iroquois leaders and European colonists in the distant summer of 1722, two white fur traders attacked an Indigenous hunter and left him for dead near Conestoga, Pennsylvania. Though virtually forgotten today, this act of brutality set into motion a remarkable series of criminal investigations and cross-cultural negotiations that challenged the definition of justice in early America.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn Covered with Night , leading historian Nicole Eustace reconstructs the crime and its aftermath, bringing us into the overlapping worlds of white colonists and Indigenous peoples in this formative period. As she shows, the murder of the Indigenous man set the entire mid-Atlantic on edge, with many believing war was imminent. Isolated killings often flared into colonial wars in North America, and colonists now anticipated a vengeful Indigenous uprising. Frantic efforts to resolve the case ignited a dramatic, far-reaching debate between Native American forms of justice\u2014centered on community, forgiveness, and reparations\u2014and an ideology of harsh reprisal, unique to the colonies and based on British law, which called for the killers\u2019 swift execution.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn charting the far-reaching ramifications of the murder, Covered with Night \u2014a phrase from Iroquois mourning practices\u2014overturns persistent assumptions about \u201ccivilized\u201d Europeans and \u201csavage\u201d Native Americans. As Eustace powerfully contends, the colonial obsession with \u201ccivility\u201d belied the reality that the Iroquois, far from being the barbarians of the white imagination, acted under a mantle of sophistication and humanity as they tried to make the land- and power-hungry colonials understand their ways. In truth, Eustace reveals, the Iroquois\u2014the Six Nations of the Haudenosaunee, as they are known today\u2014saw the killing as an opportunity to forge stronger bonds with the colonists. They argued for restorative justice and for reconciliation between the two sides, even as they mourned the deceased.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn absorbing chronicle built around an extraordinary group of characters\u2014from the slain man\u2019s resilient widow to the Indigenous diplomat known as \u201cCaptain Civility\u201d to the scheming governor of Pennsylvania\u2014 Covered with Night transforms a single event into an unforgettable portrait of early America.

From the prize-winning and bestselling author of Say Nothing The history of the Sackler dynasty is rife with drama\u2014baroque personal lives; bitter disputes over estates; fistfights in boardrooms; glittering art collections; Machiavellian courtroom maneuvers; and the calculated use of money to burnish reputations and crush the less powerful.\u00a0The Sackler name has adorned the walls of many storied institutions\u2014Harvard, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Oxford, the Louvre. They are one of the richest families in the world, known for their lavish donations to the arts and the sciences. The source of the family fortune was vague, however, until it emerged that the Sacklers were responsible for making and marketing a blockbuster painkiller that was the catalyst for the opioid crisis. Empire of Pain begins with the story of three doctor brothers, Raymond, Mortimer and the incalculably energetic Arthur, who weathered the poverty of the Great Depression and appalling anti-Semitism. Working at a barbaric mental institution, Arthur saw a better way and conducted groundbreaking research into drug treatments. He also had a genius for marketing, especially for pharmaceuticals, and bought a small ad firm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eArthur devised the marketing for Valium, and built the first great Sackler fortune. He purchased a drug manufacturer, Purdue Frederick, which would be run by Raymond and Mortimer. The brothers began collecting art, and wives, and grand residences in exotic locales. Their children and grandchildren grew up in luxury.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eForty years later, Raymond\u2019s son Richard ran the family-owned Purdue. The template Arthur Sackler created to sell Valium\u2014co-opting doctors, influencing the FDA, downplaying the drug\u2019s addictiveness\u2014was employed to launch a far more potent product: OxyContin. The drug went on to generate some thirty-five billion dollars in revenue, and to launch a public health crisis in which hundreds of thousands would die. This is the saga of three generations of a single family and the mark they would leave on the world, a tale that moves from the bustling streets of early twentieth-century Brooklyn to the seaside palaces\u00a0of Greenwich, Connecticut, and Cap d\u2019Antibes to the corridors of power in Washington, D.C.\u00a0 Empire of Pain chronicles the multiple investigations of the Sacklers and their company, and the scorched-earth legal tactics that the family has used to evade accountability.\u00a0Empire of Pain is a masterpiece of narrative reporting and writing, exhaustively documented and ferociously compelling. It is a portrait of the excesses of America\u2019s second Gilded Age, a study of impunity among the super elite and a relentless investigation of the naked greed and indifference to human suffering that built one of the world\u2019s great fortunes.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e", "custom_clean": 1, "custom_lists": [{"id": 5, "sort": "Must Read.2021 Time", "value": "Must Read.2021 Time"}], "custom_lists_ids": "5", "custom_read_date": null, "custom_reading_list": 0, "custom_types": "eBook", "flags": 1, "has_cover": 1, "id": 124, "identifier_ids": "408,406,407", "identifiers": [{"book": 124, "id": 407, "name": "ISBN", "path": "https://www.worldcat.org/isbn/9780385545693", "sort": "isbn", "type": "isbn", "val": "9780385545693"}, {"book": 124, "id": 406, "name": "Google Books", "path": "https://books.google.com/books?id=Qb4IEAAAQBAJ", "sort": "google", "type": "google", "val": "Qb4IEAAAQBAJ"}, {"book": 124, "id": 408, "name": "Goodreads", "path": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43868109", "sort": "goodreads", "type": "goodreads", "val": "43868109"}], "isbn": "9780385545693", "language_ids": "1", "languages": [{"avg_rating": 8.429245283018869, "count": 341, "id": 1, "name": "ENG", "sort": "ENG"}], "last_modified": "2023-05-04 17:55:52.136675+00:00", "order_by": "2022-10-05 15:54:07.602947+00:00", "path": "Patrick Radden Keefe/Empire of Pain_ The Secret History (124)", "pubdate": "2021-04-13", "publisher_ids": "82", "publishers": [{"avg_rating": 8.5, "count": 5, "id": 82, "name": "Knopf Publishing Group", "sort": "Knopf Publishing Group"}], "rating": 5, "series": [], "series_ids": null, "size": 5759595, "tag_ids": "51,57,58,60,92,194", "tags": [{"avg_rating": 8.333333333333334, "count": 40, "id": 194, "name": "Time", "sort": 40}, {"avg_rating": 8.222222222222221, "count": 31, "id": 92, "name": "Biography", "sort": 31}, {"avg_rating": 8.363636363636363, "count": 24, "id": 60, "name": "History", "sort": 24}, {"avg_rating": 8.347826086956522, "count": 23, "id": 57, "name": "Politics", "sort": 23}, {"avg_rating": 8.2, "count": 11, "id": 51, "name": "Business", "sort": 11}, {"avg_rating": 8.222222222222221, "count": 11, "id": 58, "name": "Science", "sort": 11}], "timestamp": "2022-10-05 15:54:07.602947+00:00", "title": "Empire of Pain: The Secret History of the Sackler Dynasty"}, {"author_ids": "125", "authors": [{"avg_rating": 8.0, "count": 1, "id": 125, "name": "Viet Thanh Nguyen", "sort": "Nguyen, Viet Thanh"}], "comments": "\u003cdiv\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sequel to The Sympathizer, which won the 2016 Pulitzer Prize in Fiction and went on to sell over a million copies worldwide, The Committed tells the story of \u201cthe man of two minds\u201d as he comes as a refugee to France and turns his hand to capitalism\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe long-awaited follow-up to the Pulitzer Prize-winning The Sympathizer, which has sold more than one million copies worldwide, The Committed follows the man of two minds as he arrives in Paris in the early 1980s with his blood brother Bon.

Beginning in his hometown of New Orleans, Clint Smith leads the reader on an unforgettable tour of monuments and landmarks--those that are honest about the past and those that are not--that offer an intergenerational story of how slavery has been central in shaping our nation\u0027s collective history, and ourselves. It is the story of the Monticello Plantation in Virginia, the estate where Thomas Jefferson wrote letters espousing the urgent need for liberty while enslaving more than four hundred people. It is the story of the Whitney Plantation, one of the only former plantations devoted to preserving the experience of the enslaved people whose lives and work sustained it. It is the story of Angola, a former plantation-turned-maximum-security prison in Louisiana that is filled with Black men who work across the 18,000-acre land for virtually no pay. And it is the story of Blandford Cemetery, the final resting place of tens of thousands of Confederate soldiers. A deeply researched and transporting exploration of the legacy of slavery and its imprint on centuries of American history, How the Word Is Passed illustrates how some of our country\u0027s most essential stories are hidden in plain view--whether in places we might drive by on our way to work, holidays such as Juneteenth, or entire neighborhoods like downtown Manhattan, where the brutal history of the trade in enslaved men, women, and children has been deeply imprinted. Informed by scholarship and brought to life by the story of people living today, Smith\u0027s debut work of nonfiction is a landmark of reflection and insight that offers a new understanding of the hopeful role that memory and history can play in making sense of our country and how it has come to be.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e", "custom_clean": 1, "custom_lists": [{"id": 5, "sort": "Must Read.2021 Time", "value": "Must Read.2021 Time"}], "custom_lists_ids": "5", "custom_read_date": null, "custom_reading_list": 0, "custom_types": "eBook", "flags": 1, "has_cover": 1, "id": 113, "identifier_ids": "374,376,375,377", "identifiers": [{"book": 113, "id": 377, "name": "ISBN", "path": "https://www.worldcat.org/isbn/9780316492935", "sort": "isbn", "type": "isbn", "val": "9780316492935"}, {"book": 113, "id": 375, "name": "Google Books", "path": "https://books.google.com/books?id=8pEHzgEACAAJ", "sort": "google", "type": "google", "val": "8pEHzgEACAAJ"}, {"book": 113, "id": 376, "name": "Goodreads", "path": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/55643287", "sort": "goodreads", "type": "goodreads", "val": "55643287"}, {"book": 113, "id": 374, "name": "Amazon", "path": "https://amazon.com/dp/0316492930", "sort": "amazon", "type": "amazon", "val": "0316492930"}], "isbn": "9780316492935", "language_ids": "1", "languages": [{"avg_rating": 8.429245283018869, "count": 341, "id": 1, "name": "ENG", "sort": "ENG"}], "last_modified": "2023-05-04 17:55:52.136675+00:00", "order_by": "2022-10-05 15:54:03.677102+00:00", "path": "Clint Smith/How the Word Is Passed_ A Reckoning (113)", "pubdate": "2021-06-01", "publisher_ids": "68", "publishers": [{"avg_rating": 8.5, "count": 4, "id": 68, "name": "Little, Brown and Company", "sort": "Little, Brown and Company"}], "rating": 5, "series": [], "series_ids": null, "size": 568333, "tag_ids": "57,60,194", "tags": [{"avg_rating": 8.333333333333334, "count": 40, "id": 194, "name": "Time", "sort": 40}, {"avg_rating": 8.363636363636363, "count": 24, "id": 60, "name": "History", "sort": 24}, {"avg_rating": 8.347826086956522, "count": 23, "id": 57, "name": "Politics", "sort": 23}], "timestamp": "2022-10-05 15:54:03.677102+00:00", "title": "How the Word Is Passed: A Reckoning With the History of Slavery Across America"}, {"author_ids": "114", "authors": [{"avg_rating": 10.0, "count": 1, "id": 114, "name": "Andrea Elliott", "sort": "Elliott, Andrea"}], "comments": "\u003cdiv\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn Invisible Child, Pulitzer Prize winner Andrea Elliott follows eight dramatic years in the life of Dasani, a girl whose imagination is as soaring as the skyscrapers near her Brooklyn shelter.

For fans of Tina Fey, David Sedaris and anyone who\u0027s ever felt like a misfit, an outrageously funny and disturbing memoir from Jenny Lawson, aka The Bloggess. \u0027When I tell people that my father is kind of a total lunatic, they laugh and nod knowingly. they assure me that theirs is too, and that he\u0027s just a \"typical father\". And they\u0027re probably right, if the typical father runs a full-time taxidermy business out of the house, and shows up at the local bar with a miniature donkey and a teddy Roosevelt impersonator, and thinks other people are weird for making such a big deal out of it. If the typical father says things like \"Happy birthday! Here\u0027s a bathtub of raccoons!\" or \"We\u0027ll have to take your car. Mine has too much blood in it,\" then yeah, he\u0027s totally normal.\u0027 When Jenny Lawson was little, all she ever wanted was to fit in. that dream was cut short by her fantastically unbalanced father and a childhood of wearing winter shoes made out of used bread sacks. It did, however, open up an opportunity for Lawson to find the humour in the strange shame-spiral that is her life, and we are all the better for it. Lawson\u0027s long-suffering husband and sweet daughter help her uncover the surprising discovery that the most terribly human moments - the ones we want to pretend never happened - are the very same moments that make us the people we are today. Like laughing at a funeral, LEt\u0027S PREtEND tHIS NEVER HAPPENED is both irreverent and impossible to hold back once you get started. \u0027the Bloggess writes stuff that actually is laugh-out-loud, but you know that really you shouldn\u0027t be laughing and probably you\u0027ll go to hell for laughing, so maybe you shouldn\u0027t read it.\u0027 Neil Gaiman \u0027Even when I was funny, I wasn\u0027t this funny.\u0027 Augusten Burroughs, author of RUNNING WItH SCISSORS\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e", "custom_clean": 1, "custom_lists": [], "custom_lists_ids": null, "custom_read_date": "2021-10-06", "custom_reading_list": 0, "custom_types": "eBook", "flags": 1, "has_cover": 1, "id": 98, "identifier_ids": "244,243,241,242", "identifiers": [{"book": 98, "id": 242, "name": "ISBN", "path": "https://www.worldcat.org/isbn/9781743096444", "sort": "isbn", "type": "isbn", "val": "9781743096444"}, {"book": 98, "id": 241, "name": "Google Books", "path": "https://books.google.com/books?id=9XJnMt0sXp4C", "sort": "google", "type": "google", "val": "9XJnMt0sXp4C"}, {"book": 98, "id": 243, "name": "Goodreads", "path": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35284712", "sort": "goodreads", "type": "goodreads", "val": "35284712"}, {"book": 98, "id": 244, "name": "Amazon", "path": "https://amazon.com/dp/0425261018", "sort": "amazon", "type": "amazon", "val": "0425261018"}], "isbn": "9781743096444", "language_ids": "1", "languages": [{"avg_rating": 8.429245283018869, "count": 341, "id": 1, "name": "ENG", "sort": "ENG"}], "last_modified": "2022-10-06 17:19:38.709950+00:00", "order_by": "2022-10-05 15:04:19.746379+00:00", "path": "Jenny Lawson/Let\u0027s Pretend This Never Happened (98)", "pubdate": "2012-04-17", "publisher_ids": "32", "publishers": [{"avg_rating": 9.0, "count": 29, "id": 32, "name": "HarperCollins", "sort": "HarperCollins"}], "rating": 4, "series": [], "series_ids": null, "size": 4201264, "tag_ids": "92", "tags": [{"avg_rating": 8.222222222222221, "count": 31, "id": 92, "name": "Biography", "sort": 31}], "timestamp": "2022-10-05 15:04:19.746379+00:00", "title": "Let\u0027s Pretend This Never Happened"}, {"author_ids": "102", "authors": [{"avg_rating": 8.0, "count": 1, "id": 102, "name": "Mindy Kaling", "sort": "Kaling, Mindy"}], "comments": "\u003cdiv\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMindy Kaling has lived many lives: the obedient child of immigrant professionals, a timid chubster afraid of her own bike, a Ben Affleck\u2013impersonating Off-Broadway performer and playwright, and, finally, a comedy writer and actress prone to starting fights with her friends and coworkers with the sentence \u201cCan I just say one last thing about this, and then I swear I\u2019ll shut up about it?\u201d\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerhaps you want to know what Mindy thinks makes a great best friend (someone who will fill your prescription in the middle of the night), or what makes a great guy (one who is aware of all elderly people in any room at any time and acts accordingly), or what is the perfect amount of fame (so famous you can never get convicted of murder in a court of law), or how to maintain a trim figure (you will not find that information in these pages).

In A Game of Thrones, an ancient kingdom was torn by the ambitions of ruthless men and women; in A Clash of Kings, war, sorcery, and madness swept over the kingdom like a voracious beast of prey. Now, as the brutal struggle for power nears its tumultuous climax, the battered and divided kingdom faces its most terrifying invasion\u2014one that is being spearheaded from beyond the grave....\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA STORM OF SWORDS\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf the five contenders for power, one is dead, another in disfavor, and still the wars rage as violently as ever, as alliances are made and broken. Joffrey, of House Lannister, sits on the Iron Throne, the uneasy ruler of the land of the Seven Kingdoms. His most bitter rival, Lord Stannis, stands defeated and disgraced, the victim of the jealous sorceress who holds him in her evil thrall. But young Robb, of House Stark, still rules the North from the fortress of Riverrun. Robb plots against his despised Lannister enemies, even as they hold his sister hostage at King\u0027s Landing, the seat of the Iron Throne. Meanwhile, making her way across a blood-drenched continent is the exiled queen, Daenerys, mistress of the only three dragons still left in the world. Filled with the stench of death and decay from the destructive dynastic war, Daenerys is gathering allies and strength for an assault on King\u0027s Landing, hoping to win back the crown she believes is rightfully hers. But as opposing forces maneuver for the final titanic showdown, an army of barbaric wildlings bent on overwhelming the Seven Kingdoms arrives from the outermost line of civilization. In their vanguard is a horde of mythical Others\u2014a supernatural army of the living dead whose animated corpses are unstoppable. And as the future of the land hangs in the balance, no one will rest in the quest for victory until the Seven Kingdoms have exploded in a veritable storm of swords.... Brilliantly conceived and grand in scope, A Storm of Swords is the incredible tale of a world of harsh beauty and powerful magic, torn by treachery, ravaged by brutality, and consumed by greed and ambition. It portrays a war-torn landscape in which nobles and commoners, heroes and villains, the freeborn and the enslaved, all struggle to survive and to find their destinies...along with the dazzling bounty and wondrous enchantment that was once their birthright in the Seven Kingdoms.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e", "custom_clean": 1, "custom_lists": [], "custom_lists_ids": null, "custom_read_date": null, "custom_reading_list": 0, "custom_types": "eBook", "flags": 1, "has_cover": 1, "id": 79, "identifier_ids": "183,184,181,182,180", "identifiers": [{"book": 79, "id": 180, "name": "ISBN", "path": "https://www.worldcat.org/isbn/9780553106633", "sort": "isbn", "type": "isbn", "val": "9780553106633"}, {"book": 79, "id": 182, "name": "Google Books", "path": "https://books.google.com/books?id=YxpbAAAAMAAJ", "sort": "google", "type": "google", "val": "YxpbAAAAMAAJ"}, {"book": 79, "id": 181, "name": "Goodreads", "path": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10396652", "sort": "goodreads", "type": "goodreads", "val": "10396652"}, {"book": 79, "id": 184, "name": "Barnes \u0026 Noble", "path": "https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/storm-of-swords-george-r-r-martin/1100179865", "sort": "barnesnoble", "type": "barnesnoble", "val": "w/storm-of-swords-george-r-r-martin/1100179865"}, {"book": 79, "id": 183, "name": "Amazon", "path": "https://amazon.com/dp/0553106635", "sort": "amazon", "type": "amazon", "val": "0553106635"}], "isbn": "9780553106633", "language_ids": "1", "languages": [{"avg_rating": 8.429245283018869, "count": 341, "id": 1, "name": "ENG", "sort": "ENG"}], "last_modified": "2022-10-06 17:19:38.709950+00:00", "order_by": "2022-10-04 19:44:41.482947+00:00", "path": "George R.R.

In a land where summers can last decades and winters a lifetime, trouble is brewing. The cold is returning, and in the frozen wastes to the north of Winterfell, sinister forces are massing beyond the kingdom\u0027s protective Wall. To the south, the king\u0027s powers are failing--his most trusted adviser dead under mysterious circumstances and his enemies emerging from the shadows of the throne.

Very soon he\u0027s lured from his duties into a hunt for a fantastic treasure discovered by archaeologists and carefully hushed up. The long-vanished Martians who once colonised the galaxy have left a buried hyperspace gateway leading to a working starship in distant orbit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKovacs uses frightening violence to get the attention of corporate sponsors even more ruthless than himself. His hastily assembled exploration team must work in a lethal fallout zone, racing to open the gate before they\u0027re stopped by radiation sickness, treacherous sabotage, or the threat of fast-evolving nanoweaponry. And there are repeated hints that if they ever make it through that gateway, worse things are waiting on the far side...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0027s all desperately tense and crafted with appalling inventiveness. Life is cheap and death is no release, because the \"cortical stack\" implanted in everyone\u0027s spine constantly records the total personality, ready for \"re-sleeving\" in a new clone body or storage in virtual reality. So Kovacs goes recruiting at the macabre Soul Market, where thanks to the war there are literal skiploads of hacked-out sections of human spine containing stacks--for sale by the kilogram.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOther ingredients include sex, voodoo, torture, multiple betrayal, cool military technology, incomprehensible alien constructions, age-old cycles of catastrophe, and--above all--extreme violence. The screw is turned further and further, beyond what seems possible. Readers may find themselves forgetting to breathe. This is a rattling good yarn, for the strong of stomach. --David Langford\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e", "custom_clean": 1, "custom_lists": [], "custom_lists_ids": null, "custom_read_date": "2022-06-08", "custom_reading_list": 0, "custom_types": "eBook", "flags": 1, "has_cover": 1, "id": 75, "identifier_ids": "169,168,166,167", "identifiers": [{"book": 75, "id": 167, "name": "ISBN", "path": "https://www.worldcat.org/isbn/9780575075504", "sort": "isbn", "type": "isbn", "val": "9780575075504"}, {"book": 75, "id": 166, "name": "Google Books", "path": "https://books.google.com/books?id=H_FyPwAACAAJ", "sort": "google", "type": "google", "val": "H_FyPwAACAAJ"}, {"book": 75, "id": 168, "name": "Goodreads", "path": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1117988", "sort": "goodreads", "type": "goodreads", "val": "1117988"}, {"book": 75, "id": 169, "name": "Amazon", "path": "https://amazon.com/dp/0345457714", "sort": "amazon", "type": "amazon", "val": "0345457714"}], "isbn": "9780575075504", "language_ids": "1", "languages": [{"avg_rating": 8.429245283018869, "count": 341, "id": 1, "name": "ENG", "sort": "ENG"}], "last_modified": "2022-10-06 17:19:38.709950+00:00", "order_by": "2022-10-04 19:29:45.875671+00:00", "path": "Richard K.

Kovacs can deal with the madness of AI. He can do his part in a battle against biomachines gone wild, search for a three-centuries-old missing weapons system, and live with a blood feud with the yakuza, and even with the betrayal of people he once trusted. But when his relationship with \u201cthe\u201d Falconer brings him an enemy specially designed to destroy him, he knows it\u2019s time to be afraid.

It Doesn\u0027t Have to Be Crazy at Work is a direct successor to Rework, the instant bestseller that showed readers a new path to working effectively. Now Fried and Heinemeier Hansson have returned with a new strategy for the ideal company culture - what they call the calm company . It is a direct attack on the chaos, anxiety and stress that plagues millions of workplaces and billions of people working their day jobs. Working to breaking point with long hours, excessive workload, and a lack of sleep have become a badge of honour for many people these days, when it should be a mark of stupidity. This isn\u0027t just a problem for large organisations; individuals, contractors and solopreneurs are burning themselves out in the very same way. As the authors reveal, the answer isn\u0027t more hours. Rather, it\u0027s less waste and fewer things that induce distraction, always-on anxiety and stress. It is time to stop celebrating crazy and start celebrating calm. Fried and Hansson have the proof to back up their argument. Calm has been the cornerstone of their company\u0027s culture since Basecamp began twenty years ago. Destined to become the management guide for the next generation, It Doesn\u0027t Have to Be Crazy at Work is a practical and inspiring distillation of their insights and experiences. It isn\u0027t a book telling you what to do.

When we bring both respect and interpersonal savvy to our work relationships, we do more than make people feel good. We enhance personal and organizational performance. And as the workplace grows more complex and competitive, managing our work relationships becomes even more essential and difficult. Now more than ever we need to work people smart. Working PeopleSmart describes the six core strategies used by people-smart individuals and shows how to apply them in the toughest workplace situations. Individuals who are people smart know how to open others up rather than make them defensive or resistant. They have a knack for diffusing tension rather than creating it. They set a good example through their own behavior on the job and can inspire and influence others with less developed skills. Working PeopleSmart can serve as your virtual coach to guide you through difficult work relationships skillfully. How do you deal with a critical colleague? Make your boss listen to you? React to an offensive joke? Get the resources you need? The authors look at over 50 real-life situations and offer people-smart prescriptions for handling them effectively. They provide coaching tips for each scenario and describe exactly what a people-smart response sounds like. As two psychologists with both organizational and clinical expertise, coauthors Mel Silberman and Freda Hansburg are highly qualified to deliver the message that we can emerge from even the toughest interpersonal moments on the job with dignity and grace. Where other books rely on typologies that categorize people according to their interpersonal styles and then offer advice on how to deal with each type, the strategies described in Working PeopleSmart are straightforward and universal. They can be used immediately to deal with any type of person or any situation, no matter how difficult or sensitive.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e", "custom_clean": 1, "custom_lists": [], "custom_lists_ids": null, "custom_read_date": null, "custom_reading_list": 0, "custom_types": "eBook", "flags": 1, "has_cover": 1, "id": 34, "identifier_ids": "122,121,123", "identifiers": [{"book": 34, "id": 123, "name": "ISBN", "path": "https://www.worldcat.org/isbn/9781576752081", "sort": "isbn", "type": "isbn", "val": "9781576752081"}, {"book": 34, "id": 121, "name": "Google Books", "path": "https://books.google.com/books?id=YZgNngEACAAJ", "sort": "google", "type": "google", "val": "YZgNngEACAAJ"}, {"book": 34, "id": 122, "name": "Goodreads", "path": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1946690", "sort": "goodreads", "type": "goodreads", "val": "1946690"}], "isbn": "9781576752081", "language_ids": "1", "languages": [{"avg_rating": 8.429245283018869, "count": 341, "id": 1, "name": "ENG", "sort": "ENG"}], "last_modified": "2022-10-06 17:19:38.709950+00:00", "order_by": "2022-10-04 13:46:41.441000+00:00", "path": "Melvin L.

So we settle for who we are, instead of striving for who we were meant to be.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRelease Your Brilliance provides the combination to the vault where your brilliance is kept. After struggling for thirty-two years with disillusion, defeat, and despair, author Simon T.

Using the metaphor that we\u0027re all diamonds in the rough, Simon shares the four key steps to cut and polish the gem that is you in order to reawaken your genius, reignite your internal light, and release your potential. He guides your transformation with interactive tools such as Personal Appraisal exercises, Diamond Polishing action steps, and true stories of Living Diamonds.

She then journeyed to the region of Geneva, Switzerland, where much of the story takes place. The topic of galvanism and occult ideas were themes of conversation among her companions, particularly her lover and future husband Percy B. Shelley. Mary, Percy and Lord Byron had a competition to see who could write the best horror story.

In the newest appealing installment of the Discworld series, Pratchett (The Truth) takes on religion, time and... kung-fu movies? The cast includes Death; Miss Susan, Death\u0027s granddaughter; Jeremy Clockson, a clockmaker; Lobsang, a novice monk; and Lu-Tze, a sweeper at the temple of the History Monks. When a mysterious lady asks Jeremy to make a clock that is perfectly timed (even to the last tick), trouble begins it seems that such a clock would have the power to stop time completely. There would be no yesterday, no tomorrow, no next minute; in fact, everything and everyone would stop in its tracks. It\u0027s up to Miss Susan, Lobsang and Lu-Tze to figure out who in the end has decided to build the dangerous clock and how to stop him before the world crashes to a halt. Along the way we learn Rule One: \"Do not act incautiously when confronting a little bald wrinkly smiling man,\" which is a very good lesson to learn. We also find out that Lobsang has more in store for his future than to be an apprentice monk. The story includes a quick nod to James Bond flicks with Qu, the monk who supplies gadgets to Lu-Tze and Lobsang, and at the end of Time the four (no, make that five) horsemen of the Apocalypse get to ride out for a jaunt. You don\u0027t need to catch all the in-jokes to enjoy the fun.

He explains that work that demands your full focus is intrinsically valuable and rewarding. You need to be able to handle \"deep work\" to succeed in an information economy. Yet people face increasing distractions or social pressure that drive them toward shallow work. Newport develops his ideas with a blend of formal research, stories and personal accounts about the challenges and rewards of deep work. He provides tips for arranging your life to support deep work, which he sees as valuable, productive and rare. He makes his case persuasively and even poetically. getAbstract recommends his guidance to knowledge workers and anyone else who is seeking flow, creativity or focus.

Fans seem driven to expand on the games they love. For some, this may involve mods (for the games that allow that). Others do artwork, or music. Others write stories. Some attempt to write novels based on the games, but sadly many fan novelizations of games are little more than transcripts. There is at least one that isn\u0027t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFirst appearing in installments on the now-defunct website Glottis\u0027 Garage, the Grim Fandango novel by MeddlingMonk was initially well received. Although still sought after, it has become increasingly hard to find. Many plot points are developed more fully and the entire text has been tweaked to become more textured, more adult. If the game was intended to reflect film noir, then the novel is meant to key off of the writings of Dashiell Hammett, Raymond Chandler and Ross Macdonald.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlthough adapted from an episodic game, the Grim Fandango novel presents a continuous story, filling in the gaps using hints from the game itself (including unused elements found in the game\u0027s data) or by using reasonable extrapolations. The result has given some readers the eerie feeling--despite knowing better--that it is the game that is the adaptation. If Tim Schafer had been a hardboiled novelist rather than a game designer, he might have come up with something like this.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e", "custom_clean": 1, "custom_lists": [], "custom_lists_ids": null, "custom_read_date": null, "custom_reading_list": 0, "custom_types": "Comic", "flags": 1, "has_cover": 1, "id": 362, "identifier_ids": null, "identifiers": [], "isbn": null, "language_ids": "1", "languages": [{"avg_rating": 8.429245283018869, "count": 341, "id": 1, "name": "ENG", "sort": "ENG"}], "last_modified": "2023-07-16 18:56:10.618541+00:00", "order_by": "2020-05-26 21:33:05.709000+00:00", "path": "Charles Frederick/Grim Fandango (362)", "pubdate": "2008-05-14", "publisher_ids": "117", "publishers": [{"avg_rating": 7.6, "count": 15, "id": 117, "name": "Independently Published", "sort": "Independently Published"}], "rating": null, "series": [], "series_ids": null, "size": 2968699, "tag_ids": "184,369", "tags": [{"avg_rating": 8.435897435897436, "count": 58, "id": 184, "name": "Comics \u0026 Graphic Novels", "sort": 58}, {"avg_rating": 4.0, "count": 5, "id": 369, "name": "Games", "sort": 5}], "timestamp": "2020-05-26 21:33:05.709000+00:00", "title": "Grim Fandango"}, {"author_ids": "246", "authors": [{"avg_rating": null, "count": 1, "id": 246, "name": "Mark Twain", "sort": "Twain, Mark"}], "comments": "\u003cdiv\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHilariously picaresque, epic in scope, alive with the poetry and vigor of the American people, Mark Twain\u0027s story about a young boy and his journey down the Mississippi was the first great novel to speak in a truly American voice.

In 1942, with Nazis occupying Holland, a thirteen-year-old Jewish girl and her family fled their home in Amsterdam and went into hiding. For the next two years, until their whereabouts were betrayed to the Gestapo, they and another family lived cloistered in the \"Secret Annex\" of an old office building. Cut off from the outside world, they faced hunger, boredom, the constant cruelties of living in confined quarters, and the ever-present threat of discovery and death. In her diary Anne Frank recorded vivid impressions of her experiences during this period. By turns thoughtful, moving, and amusing, her account offers a fascinating commentary on human courage and frailty and a compelling self-portrait of a sensitive and spirited young woman whose promise was tragically cut short.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e", "custom_clean": 1, "custom_lists": [{"id": 14, "sort": "Must Read.25 Must Read", "value": "Must Read.25 Must Read"}], "custom_lists_ids": "14", "custom_read_date": null, "custom_reading_list": 0, "custom_types": "eBook", "flags": 1, "has_cover": 1, "id": 437, "identifier_ids": "1264,1265", "identifiers": [{"book": 437, "id": 1265, "name": "ISBN", "path": "https://www.worldcat.org/isbn/9780553577129", "sort": "isbn", "type": "isbn", "val": "9780553577129"}, {"book": 437, "id": 1264, "name": "Google Books", "path": "https://books.google.com/books?id=Z-SoMQEACAAJ", "sort": "google", "type": "google", "val": "Z-SoMQEACAAJ"}], "isbn": "9780553577129", "language_ids": "1", "languages": [{"avg_rating": 8.429245283018869, "count": 341, "id": 1, "name": "ENG", "sort": "ENG"}], "last_modified": "2023-07-21 14:29:11.123443+00:00", "order_by": "2020-03-03 23:00:00+00:00", "path": "Anne Frank/The Diary of a Young Girl_ The Defi (437)", "pubdate": "1997-07-14", "publisher_ids": "212", "publishers": [{"avg_rating": 8.0, "count": 1, "id": 212, "name": "Bantam Books", "sort": "Bantam Books"}], "rating": 4, "series": [], "series_ids": null, "size": 480624, "tag_ids": "60,428,438,439", "tags": [{"avg_rating": 8.363636363636363, "count": 24, "id": 60, "name": "History", "sort": 24}, {"avg_rating": 9.0, "count": 2, "id": 428, "name": "Holocaust", "sort": 2}, {"avg_rating": 8.0, "count": 1, "id": 438, "name": "Holocaust; Jewish", "sort": 1}, {"avg_rating": 8.0, "count": 1, "id": 439, "name": "Netherlands", "sort": 1}], "timestamp": "2020-03-03 23:00:00+00:00", "title": "The Diary of a Young Girl: The Definitive Edition"}, {"author_ids": "465", "authors": [{"avg_rating": 10.0, "count": 2, "id": 465, "name": "John Steinbeck", "sort": "Steinbeck, John"}], "comments": "\u003cdiv\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFirst published in 1939, Steinbeck\u2019s Pulitzer Prize-winning epic of the Great Depression chronicles the Dust Bowl migration of the 1930s and tells the story of one Oklahoma farm family, the Joads\u2014driven from their homestead and forced to travel west to the promised land of California. Out of their trials and their repeated collisions against the hard realities of an America divided into Haves and Have-Nots evolves a drama that is intensely human yet majestic in its scale and moral vision, elemental yet plainspoken, tragic but ultimately stirring in its human dignity. A portrait of the conflict between the powerful and the powerless, of one man\u2019s fierce reaction to injustice, and of one woman\u2019s stoical strength, the novel captures the horrors of the Great Depression and probes into the very nature of equality and justice in America. At once a naturalistic epic, captivity narrative, road novel, and transcendental gospel, Steinbeck\u2019s powerful landmark novel is perhaps the most American of American Classics. \u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e", "custom_clean": 1, "custom_lists": [{"id": 14, "sort": "Must Read.25 Must Read", "value": "Must Read.25 Must Read"}], "custom_lists_ids": "14", "custom_read_date": null, "custom_reading_list": 0, "custom_types": "eBook", "flags": 1, "has_cover": 1, "id": 446, "identifier_ids": "1239,1238,1240", "identifiers": [{"book": 446, "id": 1240, "name": "ISBN", "path": "https://www.worldcat.org/isbn/9780143039433", "sort": "isbn", "type": "isbn", "val": "9780143039433"}, {"book": 446, "id": 1238, "name": "Google Books", "path": "https://books.google.com/books?id=bhJgd3hGdxQC", "sort": "google", "type": "google", "val": "bhJgd3hGdxQC"}, {"book": 446, "id": 1239, "name": "Amazon", "path": "https://amazon.com/dp/0143039431", "sort": "amazon", "type": "amazon", "val": "0143039431"}], "isbn": "9780143039433", "language_ids": "1", "languages": [{"avg_rating": 8.429245283018869, "count": 341, "id": 1, "name": "ENG", "sort": "ENG"}], "last_modified": "2023-07-21 14:32:47.527874+00:00", "order_by": "2020-03-03 23:00:00+00:00", "path": "John Steinbeck/The Grapes of Wrath (446)", "pubdate": "2006-03-27", "publisher_ids": "90", "publishers": [{"avg_rating": 8.8, "count": 20, "id": 90, "name": "Penguin Random House", "sort": "Penguin Random House"}], "rating": 5, "series": [], "series_ids": null, "size": 1950305, "tag_ids": "4,148,152,153,349,400,401,402,403,404,405,406,407", "tags": [{"avg_rating": 9.25, "count": 97, "id": 4, "name": "Fiction", "sort": 97}, {"avg_rating": 8.461538461538462, "count": 47, "id": 349, "name": "General", "sort": 47}, {"avg_rating": 8.578947368421053, "count": 28, "id": 153, "name": "Classics", "sort": 28}, {"avg_rating": 9.0, "count": 11, "id": 152, "name": "Literary", "sort": 11}, {"avg_rating": 9.333333333333334, "count": 5, "id": 148, "name": "Historical", "sort": 5}, {"avg_rating": 10.0, "count": 1, "id": 400, "name": "Domestic fiction", "sort": 1}, {"avg_rating": 10.0, "count": 1, "id": 401, "name": "Political fiction", "sort": 1}, {"avg_rating": 10.0, "count": 1, "id": 402, "name": "California", "sort": 1}, {"avg_rating": 10.0, "count": 1, "id": 403, "name": "Rural families", "sort": 1}, {"avg_rating": 10.0, "count": 1, "id": 404, "name": "Migrant agricultural laborers", "sort": 1}, {"avg_rating": 10.0, "count": 1, "id": 405, "name": "Depressions", "sort": 1}, {"avg_rating": 10.0, "count": 1, "id": 406, "name": "Labor camps", "sort": 1}, {"avg_rating": 10.0, "count": 1, "id": 407, "name": "Oklahoma", "sort": 1}], "timestamp": "2020-03-03 23:00:00+00:00", "title": "The Grapes of Wrath"}, {"author_ids": "484", "authors": [{"avg_rating": 10.0, "count": 1, "id": 484, "name": "Markus Zusak", "sort": "Zusak, Markus"}], "comments": "\u003cdiv\u003e\n\u003cp style=\"font-style: italic\"\u003eWhen Death has a story to tell, you listen. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt is 1939.

A classic of English literature, written with incisive wit and superb character delineation, it centres on the turbulent relationship between Elizabeth Bennet, the daughter of a country gentleman, and Fitzwilliam Darcy, a rich aristocratic landowner. The work, which Austen initially titled First Impressions, is the second of four novels that Austen published during her lifetime. Although Pride and Prejudice has been criticized for its lack of historical context, the existence of its characters in a social bubble that is rarely penetrated by events beyond it is an accurate portrayal of the enclosed social world in which Austen lived. She depicted that world, in all its own narrow pride and prejudice, with unswerving accuracy and satire. At the same time, she placed at its centre, as both its prime actor and most perceptive critic, a character so well conceived and rendered that the reader cannot but be gripped by her story and wish for its happy d\u00e9nouement. In the end, Austen\u0027s novel has remained popular largely because of Elizabeth-who was reportedly Austen\u0027s own favourite among all her heroines-and because of the enduring appeal to men and women alike of a well-told and potentially happily ending love story. Pride and Prejudice inspired various stage, film, and television productions. One of its most notable adaptations was a 1995 TV miniseries starring Jennifer Ehle (Elizabeth) and Colin Firth (Darcy). Parents need to know that Jane Austen\u0027s romantic masterpiece, Pride and Prejudice, is an absolute joy to read and study for teens who are open to the pleasures of 19th-century prose and manners.

After eighteen years as a political prisoner in the Bastille the aging Dr Manette is finally released and reunited with his daughter in England. There, two very different men, Charles Darnay, an exiled French aristocrat, and Sydney Carton, a disreputable but brilliant English lawyer, become enmeshed through their love for Lucie Manette. From the tranquil lanes of London, they are all drawn against their will to the vengeful, bloodstained streets of Paris at the height of the Reign of Terror and soon fall under the lethal shadow of La Guillotine.

Browne (\u0027Phiz\u0027).

Balls and soires, the burning of Moscow, the intrigues of statesmen and generals, scenes of violent battles, the quiet moments of everyday life--all in a work whose extraordinary imaginative power has never been surpassed. The Maudes\u0027 translation of Tolstoy\u0027s epic masterpiece has long been considered the best English version, and now for the first time it has been revised to bring it fully into line with modern approaches to the text. French passages are restored, Anglicization of Russian names removed, and outmoded expressions updated. A new introduction by Amy Mandelker considers the novel\u0027s literary and historical context, the nature of the work, and Tolstoy\u0027s artistic and philosophical aims.

Living Down and Out in Paris and London , repudiating respectable imperialist society, and reinventing himself as George Orwell. His 1933 debut book (ostensibly a novel, but overwhelmingly autobiographical) was rejected by that elitist publisher T. S. Eliot, perhaps because its close-up portrait of lowlife was too pungent for comfort.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn Paris, Orwell lived in verminous rooms and washed dishes at the overpriced \"Hotel X,\" in a remarkably filthy, 110-degree kitchen. He met \"eccentric people \u2013 people who have fallen into solitary, half-mad grooves of life and given up trying to be normal or decent.\" Though Orwell\u0027s tone is that of an outraged reformer, it\u0027s surprising how entertaining many of his adventures are: gnawing poverty only enlivens the imagination, and the wild characters he met often swindled each other and themselves. The wackiest tale involves a miser who ate cats, wore newspapers for underwear, invested 6,000 francs in cocaine, and hid it in a face-powder tin when the cops raided. They had to free him, because the apparently controlled substance turned out to be face powder instead of cocaine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn London, Orwell studied begging with a crippled expert named Bozo, a great storyteller and philosopher. Orwell devotes a chapter to the fine points of London guttersnipe slang. Years later, he would put his lexical bent to work by inventing Newspeak, and draw on his down-and-out experience to evoke the plight of the Proles in 1984. Though marred by hints of unexamined anti-Semitism, Orwell\u0027s debut remains, as The Nation put it, \"the most lucid portrait of poverty in the English language.\" --Tim Appelo\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e", "custom_clean": 1, "custom_lists": [], "custom_lists_ids": null, "custom_read_date": null, "custom_reading_list": 0, "custom_types": "eBook", "flags": 1, "has_cover": 1, "id": 159, "identifier_ids": "483,484,481,482", "identifiers": [{"book": 159, "id": 482, "name": "ISBN", "path": "https://www.worldcat.org/isbn/9780156262248", "sort": "isbn", "type": "isbn", "val": "9780156262248"}, {"book": 159, "id": 481, "name": "Google Books", "path": "https://books.google.com/books?id=m5vIVN7LjtgC", "sort": "google", "type": "google", "val": "m5vIVN7LjtgC"}, {"book": 159, "id": 484, "name": "Goodreads", "path": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34304872", "sort": "goodreads", "type": "goodreads", "val": "34304872"}, {"book": 159, "id": 483, "name": "Amazon", "path": "https://amazon.com/dp/015626224X", "sort": "amazon", "type": "amazon", "val": "015626224X"}], "isbn": "9780156262248", "language_ids": "1", "languages": [{"avg_rating": 8.429245283018869, "count": 341, "id": 1, "name": "ENG", "sort": "ENG"}], "last_modified": "2023-05-04 17:55:52.136675+00:00", "order_by": "2022-10-06 09:35:53.313990+00:00", "path": "George Orwell/Down and Out in Paris and London (159)", "pubdate": "1933-01-01", "publisher_ids": "90", "publishers": [{"avg_rating": 8.8, "count": 20, "id": 90, "name": "Penguin Random House", "sort": "Penguin Random House"}], "rating": 4, "series": [], "series_ids": null, "size": 690052, "tag_ids": "57,60,90,92,153", "tags": [{"avg_rating": 8.222222222222221, "count": 31, "id": 92, "name": "Biography", "sort": 31}, {"avg_rating": 8.578947368421053, "count": 28, "id": 153, "name": "Classics", "sort": 28}, {"avg_rating": 8.363636363636363, "count": 24, "id": 60, "name": "History", "sort": 24}, {"avg_rating": 8.347826086956522, "count": 23, "id": 57, "name": "Politics", "sort": 23}, {"avg_rating": 7.5, "count": 4, "id": 90, "name": "Travel", "sort": 4}], "timestamp": "2022-10-06 09:35:53.313990+00:00", "title": "Down and Out in Paris and London"}, {"author_ids": "161", "authors": [{"avg_rating": 8.0, "count": 1, "id": 161, "name": "Rutger Bregman", "sort": "Bregman, Rutger"}], "comments": "\u003cdiv\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDe mens is een beest, zeiden de koningen.

Sullivan, Jr., Washington Post From one of our top historians, a groundbreaking story of policing and \u201criots\u201d that shatters our understanding of the post\u2013civil rights era. What began in spring 2020 as local protests in response to the killing of George Floyd by Minneapolis police quickly exploded into a massive nationwide movement. Millions of mostly young people defiantly flooded into the nation\u2019s streets, demanding an end to police brutality and to the broader, systemic repression of Black people and other people of color. To many observers, the protests appeared to be without precedent in their scale and persistence. Yet, as the acclaimed historian Elizabeth Hinton demonstrates in America on Fire, the events of 2020 had clear precursors\u2014and any attempt to understand our current crisis requires a reckoning with the recent past. Even in the aftermath of Donald Trump, many Americans consider the decades since the civil rights movement in the mid-1960s as a story of progress toward greater inclusiveness and equality. Hinton\u2019s sweeping narrative uncovers an altogether different history, taking us on a troubling journey from Detroit in 1967 and Miami in 1980 to Los Angeles in 1992 and beyond to chart the persistence of structural racism and one of its primary consequences, the so-called urban riot. Hinton offers a critical corrective: the word riot was nothing less than a racist trope applied to events that can only be properly understood as rebellions\u2014explosions of collective resistance to an unequal and violent order. As she suggests, if rebellion and the conditions that precipitated it never disappeared, the optimistic story of a post\u2013Jim Crow United States no longer holds. Black rebellion, America on Fire powerfully illustrates, was born in response to poverty and exclusion, but most immediately in reaction to police violence. In 1968, President Lyndon Johnson launched the \u201cWar on Crime,\u201d sending militarized police forces into impoverished Black neighborhoods. Facing increasing surveillance and brutality, residents threw rocks and Molotov cocktails at officers, plundered local businesses, and vandalized exploitative institutions. Hinton draws on exclusive sources to uncover a previously hidden geography of violence in smaller American cities, from York, Pennsylvania, to Cairo, Illinois, to Stockton, California. The central lesson from these eruptions\u2014that police violence invariably leads to community violence\u2014continues to escape policymakers, who respond by further criminalizing entire groups instead of addressing underlying socioeconomic causes. The results are the hugely expanded policing and prison regimes that shape the lives of so many Americans today. Presenting a new framework for understanding our nation\u2019s enduring strife, America on Fire is also a warning: rebellions will surely continue unless police are no longer called on to manage the consequences of dismal conditions beyond their control, and until an oppressive system is finally remade on the principles of justice and equality.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e", "custom_clean": 1, "custom_lists": [{"id": 5, "sort": "Must Read.2021 Time", "value": "Must Read.2021 Time"}], "custom_lists_ids": "5", "custom_read_date": null, "custom_reading_list": 0, "custom_types": "eBook", "flags": 1, "has_cover": 1, "id": 144, "identifier_ids": "351,352,353", "identifiers": [{"book": 144, "id": 353, "name": "ISBN", "path": "https://www.worldcat.org/isbn/9781631498916", "sort": "isbn", "type": "isbn", "val": "9781631498916"}, {"book": 144, "id": 352, "name": "Google Books", "path": "https://books.google.com/books?id=PAwDEAAAQBAJ", "sort": "google", "type": "google", "val": "PAwDEAAAQBAJ"}, {"book": 144, "id": 351, "name": "Goodreads", "path": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/55298326", "sort": "goodreads", "type": "goodreads", "val": "55298326"}], "isbn": "9781631498916", "language_ids": "1", "languages": [{"avg_rating": 8.429245283018869, "count": 341, "id": 1, "name": "ENG", "sort": "ENG"}], "last_modified": "2023-05-04 17:55:52.136675+00:00", "order_by": "2022-10-05 15:54:15.142378+00:00", "path": "Elizabeth Hinton/America on Fire_ The Untold History (144)", "pubdate": "2021-05-18", "publisher_ids": "84", "publishers": [{"avg_rating": 8.0, "count": 4, "id": 84, "name": "Liveright Publishing", "sort": "Liveright Publishing"}], "rating": 4, "series": [], "series_ids": null, "size": 12900649, "tag_ids": "57,60,194", "tags": [{"avg_rating": 8.333333333333334, "count": 40, "id": 194, "name": "Time", "sort": 40}, {"avg_rating": 8.363636363636363, "count": 24, "id": 60, "name": "History", "sort": 24}, {"avg_rating": 8.347826086956522, "count": 23, "id": 57, "name": "Politics", "sort": 23}], "timestamp": "2022-10-05 15:54:15.142378+00:00", "title": "America on Fire: The Untold History of Police Violence and Black Rebellion Since the 1960s"}, {"author_ids": "145", "authors": [{"avg_rating": 8.0, "count": 1, "id": 145, "name": "Elizabeth Kolbert", "sort": "Kolbert, Elizabeth"}], "comments": "\u003cdiv\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNATIONAL BESTSELLER * The Pulitzer Prize-winning author of The Sixth Extinction returns to humanity\u0027s transformative impact on the environment, now asking: After doing so much damage, can we change nature, this time to save it?

So pervasive are human impacts on the planet that it\u0027s said we live in a new geological epoch: the Anthropocene. In Under a White Sky, Elizabeth Kolbert takes a hard look at the new world we are creating. Along the way, she meets biologists who are trying to preserve the world\u0027s rarest fish, which lives in a single tiny pool in the middle of the Mojave; engineers who are turning carbon emissions to stone in Iceland; Australian researchers who are trying to develop a \"super coral\" that can survive on a hotter globe; and physicists who are contemplating shooting tiny diamonds into the stratosphere to cool the earth. One way to look at human civilization, says Kolbert, is as a ten-thousand-year exercise in defying nature. In The Sixth Extinction, she explored the ways in which our capacity for destruction has reshaped the natural world. Now she examines how the very sorts of interventions that have imperiled our planet are increasingly seen as the only hope for its salvation. By turns inspiring, terrifying, and darkly comic, Under a White Sky is an utterly original examination of the challenges we face.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e", "custom_clean": 1, "custom_lists": [{"id": 5, "sort": "Must Read.2021 Time", "value": "Must Read.2021 Time"}], "custom_lists_ids": "5", "custom_read_date": null, "custom_reading_list": 0, "custom_types": "eBook", "flags": 1, "has_cover": 1, "id": 143, "identifier_ids": "462,461,460,459", "identifiers": [{"book": 143, "id": 459, "name": "ISBN", "path": "https://www.worldcat.org/isbn/9780593136287", "sort": "isbn", "type": "isbn", "val": "9780593136287"}, {"book": 143, "id": 460, "name": "Google Books", "path": "https://books.google.com/books?id=qwpjEAAAQBAJ", "sort": "google", "type": "google", "val": "qwpjEAAAQBAJ"}, {"book": 143, "id": 461, "name": "Goodreads", "path": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/60757903", "sort": "goodreads", "type": "goodreads", "val": "60757903"}, {"book": 143, "id": 462, "name": "Amazon", "path": "https://amazon.com/dp/B08DMWR6BP", "sort": "amazon", "type": "amazon", "val": "B08DMWR6BP"}], "isbn": "9780593136287", "language_ids": "1", "languages": [{"avg_rating": 8.429245283018869, "count": 341, "id": 1, "name": "ENG", "sort": "ENG"}], "last_modified": "2023-05-04 17:55:52.136675+00:00", "order_by": "2022-10-05 15:54:14.761371+00:00", "path": "Elizabeth Kolbert/Under a White Sky_ The Nature of th (143)", "pubdate": "2021-02-09", "publisher_ids": "100", "publishers": [{"avg_rating": 8.0, "count": 6, "id": 100, "name": "Crown Publishing Group", "sort": "Crown Publishing Group"}], "rating": 4, "series": [], "series_ids": null, "size": 4317039, "tag_ids": "57,58,60,125,194,253", "tags": [{"avg_rating": 8.333333333333334, "count": 40, "id": 194, "name": "Time", "sort": 40}, {"avg_rating": 8.363636363636363, "count": 24, "id": 60, "name": "History", "sort": 24}, {"avg_rating": 8.347826086956522, "count": 23, "id": 57, "name": "Politics", "sort": 23}, {"avg_rating": 8.222222222222221, "count": 11, "id": 58, "name": "Science", "sort": 11}, {"avg_rating": 8.0, "count": 2, "id": 253, "name": "Non-Fiction", "sort": 2}, {"avg_rating": 8.0, "count": 1, "id": 125, "name": "Climate Crisis", "sort": 1}], "timestamp": "2022-10-05 15:54:14.761371+00:00", "title": "Under a White Sky: The Nature of the Future"}, {"author_ids": "140", "authors": [{"avg_rating": 10.0, "count": 1, "id": 140, "name": "Heather McGhee", "sort": "McGhee, Heather"}], "comments": "\u003cdiv\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHeather McGhee\u0027s specialty is the American economy--and the mystery of why it so often fails the American public.

Nobody, including the lawmakers who passed the bill, expected it to transform the country\u2019s demographics. But over the next four decades, millions arrived, including Jay Caspian Kang\u2019s parents, grandparents, aunts, and uncles. They came with almost no understanding of their new home, much less the history of \u201cAsian America\u201d that was supposed to define them.\u00a0The Loneliest Americans is the unforgettable story of Kang and his family as they move from a housing project in Cambridge to an idyllic college town in the South and eventually to the West Coast. Their story unfolds against the backdrop of a rapidly expanding Asian America, as millions more immigrants, many of them working-class or undocumented, stream into the country.

It was also about ideas, in the broadest sense\u2014economic and political, artistic and personal. In The Free World, the acclaimed Pulitzer Prize\u2013winning scholar and critic Louis Menand tells the story of American culture in the pivotal years from the end of World War II to Vietnam and shows how changing economic, technological, and social forces put their mark on creations of the mind. How did elitism and an anti-totalitarian skepticism of passion and ideology give way to a new sensibility defined by freewheeling experimentation and loving the Beatles? How was the ideal of \u201cfreedom\u201d applied to causes that ranged from anti-communism and civil rights to radical acts of self-creation via art and even crime? With the wit and insight familiar to readers of The Metaphysical Club and his New Yorker essays, Menand takes us inside Hannah Arendt\u2019s Manhattan, the Paris of Jean-Paul Sartre and Simone de Beauvoir, Merce Cunningham and John Cage\u2019s residencies at North Carolina\u2019s Black Mountain College, and the Memphis studio where Sam Phillips and Elvis Presley created a new music for the American teenager. He examines the post war vogue for French existentialism, structuralism and post-structuralism, the rise of abstract expressionism and pop art, Allen Ginsberg\u2019s friendship with Lionel Trilling, James Baldwin\u2019s transformation into a Civil Right spokesman, Susan Sontag\u2019s challenges to the New York Intellectuals, the defeat of obscenity laws, and the rise of the New Hollywood. Stressing the rich flow of ideas across the Atlantic, he also shows how Europeans played a vital role in promoting and influencing American art and entertainment. By the end of the Vietnam era, the American government had lost the moral prestige it enjoyed at the end of the Second World War, but America\u2019s once-despised culture had become respected and adored. With unprecedented verve and range, this book explains how that happened.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e", "custom_clean": 1, "custom_lists": [{"id": 5, "sort": "Must Read.2021 Time", "value": "Must Read.2021 Time"}], "custom_lists_ids": "5", "custom_read_date": null, "custom_reading_list": 0, "custom_types": "eBook", "flags": 1, "has_cover": 1, "id": 132, "identifier_ids": "315,316,317", "identifiers": [{"book": 132, "id": 317, "name": "ISBN", "path": "https://www.worldcat.org/isbn/9780374722913", "sort": "isbn", "type": "isbn", "val": "9780374722913"}, {"book": 132, "id": 316, "name": "Google Books", "path": "https://books.google.com/books?id=rrziDwAAQBAJ", "sort": "google", "type": "google", "val": "rrziDwAAQBAJ"}, {"book": 132, "id": 315, "name": "Goodreads", "path": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/53317422", "sort": "goodreads", "type": "goodreads", "val": "53317422"}], "isbn": "9780374722913", "language_ids": "1", "languages": [{"avg_rating": 8.429245283018869, "count": 341, "id": 1, "name": "ENG", "sort": "ENG"}], "last_modified": "2023-05-04 17:55:52.136675+00:00", "order_by": "2022-10-05 15:54:10.771659+00:00", "path": "Louis Menand/The Free World_ Art and Thought in (132)", "pubdate": "2021-04-20", "publisher_ids": "71", "publishers": [{"avg_rating": 8.0, "count": 4, "id": 71, "name": "Farrar, Straus and Giroux", "sort": "Farrar, Straus and Giroux"}], "rating": 4, "series": [], "series_ids": null, "size": 35444855, "tag_ids": "44,57,60,62,132,194", "tags": [{"avg_rating": 8.333333333333334, "count": 40, "id": 194, "name": "Time", "sort": 40}, {"avg_rating": 8.363636363636363, "count": 24, "id": 60, "name": "History", "sort": 24}, {"avg_rating": 8.347826086956522, "count": 23, "id": 57, "name": "Politics", "sort": 23}, {"avg_rating": 7.833333333333333, "count": 12, "id": 62, "name": "Philosophy", "sort": 12}, {"avg_rating": 8.0, "count": 6, "id": 44, "name": "Art", "sort": 6}, {"avg_rating": 7.6, "count": 6, "id": 132, "name": "Music", "sort": 6}], "timestamp": "2022-10-05 15:54:10.771659+00:00", "title": "The Free World: Art and Thought in the Cold War"}, {"author_ids": "163", "authors": [{"avg_rating": 8.0, "count": 1, "id": 163, "name": "Weiwei Ai", "sort": "Ai, Weiwei"}], "comments": "\u003cdiv\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce an intimate of Mao Zedong and the nation\u0027s most celebrated poet, Ai Weiwei\u0027s father, Ai Qing, was branded a rightist during the Cultural Revolution, and he and his family were banished to a desolate place known as \"Little Siberia,\" where Ai Qing was sentenced to hard labor cleaning public toilets.

As she shows, the murder of the Indigenous man set the entire mid-Atlantic on edge, with many believing war was imminent. Isolated killings often flared into colonial wars in North America, and colonists now anticipated a vengeful Indigenous uprising. Frantic efforts to resolve the case ignited a dramatic, far-reaching debate between Native American forms of justice\u2014centered on community, forgiveness, and reparations\u2014and an ideology of harsh reprisal, unique to the colonies and based on British law, which called for the killers\u2019 swift execution.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn charting the far-reaching ramifications of the murder, Covered with Night \u2014a phrase from Iroquois mourning practices\u2014overturns persistent assumptions about \u201ccivilized\u201d Europeans and \u201csavage\u201d Native Americans. As Eustace powerfully contends, the colonial obsession with \u201ccivility\u201d belied the reality that the Iroquois, far from being the barbarians of the white imagination, acted under a mantle of sophistication and humanity as they tried to make the land- and power-hungry colonials understand their ways. In truth, Eustace reveals, the Iroquois\u2014the Six Nations of the Haudenosaunee, as they are known today\u2014saw the killing as an opportunity to forge stronger bonds with the colonists.

From the prize-winning and bestselling author of Say Nothing The history of the Sackler dynasty is rife with drama\u2014baroque personal lives; bitter disputes over estates; fistfights in boardrooms; glittering art collections; Machiavellian courtroom maneuvers; and the calculated use of money to burnish reputations and crush the less powerful.\u00a0The Sackler name has adorned the walls of many storied institutions\u2014Harvard, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Oxford, the Louvre. They are one of the richest families in the world, known for their lavish donations to the arts and the sciences. The source of the family fortune was vague, however, until it emerged that the Sacklers were responsible for making and marketing a blockbuster painkiller that was the catalyst for the opioid crisis. Empire of Pain begins with the story of three doctor brothers, Raymond, Mortimer and the incalculably energetic Arthur, who weathered the poverty of the Great Depression and appalling anti-Semitism. Working at a barbaric mental institution, Arthur saw a better way and conducted groundbreaking research into drug treatments. He also had a genius for marketing, especially for pharmaceuticals, and bought a small ad firm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eArthur devised the marketing for Valium, and built the first great Sackler fortune. He purchased a drug manufacturer, Purdue Frederick, which would be run by Raymond and Mortimer. The brothers began collecting art, and wives, and grand residences in exotic locales. Their children and grandchildren grew up in luxury.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eForty years later, Raymond\u2019s son Richard ran the family-owned Purdue. The template Arthur Sackler created to sell Valium\u2014co-opting doctors, influencing the FDA, downplaying the drug\u2019s addictiveness\u2014was employed to launch a far more potent product: OxyContin. The drug went on to generate some thirty-five billion dollars in revenue, and to launch a public health crisis in which hundreds of thousands would die. This is the saga of three generations of a single family and the mark they would leave on the world, a tale that moves from the bustling streets of early twentieth-century Brooklyn to the seaside palaces\u00a0of Greenwich, Connecticut, and Cap d\u2019Antibes to the corridors of power in Washington, D.C.\u00a0 Empire of Pain chronicles the multiple investigations of the Sacklers and their company, and the scorched-earth legal tactics that the family has used to evade accountability.\u00a0Empire of Pain is a masterpiece of narrative reporting and writing, exhaustively documented and ferociously compelling. It is a portrait of the excesses of America\u2019s second Gilded Age, a study of impunity among the super elite and a relentless investigation of the naked greed and indifference to human suffering that built one of the world\u2019s great fortunes.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e", "custom_clean": 1, "custom_lists": [{"id": 5, "sort": "Must Read.2021 Time", "value": "Must Read.2021 Time"}], "custom_lists_ids": "5", "custom_read_date": null, "custom_reading_list": 0, "custom_types": "eBook", "flags": 1, "has_cover": 1, "id": 124, "identifier_ids": "408,406,407", "identifiers": [{"book": 124, "id": 407, "name": "ISBN", "path": "https://www.worldcat.org/isbn/9780385545693", "sort": "isbn", "type": "isbn", "val": "9780385545693"}, {"book": 124, "id": 406, "name": "Google Books", "path": "https://books.google.com/books?id=Qb4IEAAAQBAJ", "sort": "google", "type": "google", "val": "Qb4IEAAAQBAJ"}, {"book": 124, "id": 408, "name": "Goodreads", "path": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43868109", "sort": "goodreads", "type": "goodreads", "val": "43868109"}], "isbn": "9780385545693", "language_ids": "1", "languages": [{"avg_rating": 8.429245283018869, "count": 341, "id": 1, "name": "ENG", "sort": "ENG"}], "last_modified": "2023-05-04 17:55:52.136675+00:00", "order_by": "2022-10-05 15:54:07.602947+00:00", "path": "Patrick Radden Keefe/Empire of Pain_ The Secret History (124)", "pubdate": "2021-04-13", "publisher_ids": "82", "publishers": [{"avg_rating": 8.5, "count": 5, "id": 82, "name": "Knopf Publishing Group", "sort": "Knopf Publishing Group"}], "rating": 5, "series": [], "series_ids": null, "size": 5759595, "tag_ids": "51,57,58,60,92,194", "tags": [{"avg_rating": 8.333333333333334, "count": 40, "id": 194, "name": "Time", "sort": 40}, {"avg_rating": 8.222222222222221, "count": 31, "id": 92, "name": "Biography", "sort": 31}, {"avg_rating": 8.363636363636363, "count": 24, "id": 60, "name": "History", "sort": 24}, {"avg_rating": 8.347826086956522, "count": 23, "id": 57, "name": "Politics", "sort": 23}, {"avg_rating": 8.2, "count": 11, "id": 51, "name": "Business", "sort": 11}, {"avg_rating": 8.222222222222221, "count": 11, "id": 58, "name": "Science", "sort": 11}], "timestamp": "2022-10-05 15:54:07.602947+00:00", "title": "Empire of Pain: The Secret History of the Sackler Dynasty"}, {"author_ids": "115", "authors": [{"avg_rating": 10.0, "count": 1, "id": 115, "name": "Clint Smith", "sort": "Smith, Clint"}], "comments": "\u003cdiv\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInstant #1 New York Times Bestseller Winner of the National Book Critics Circle Award for Nonfiction Winner of the Stowe Prize Winner of 2022 Hillman Prize for Book Journalism PEN America 2022 John Kenneth Galbraith Award for Nonfiction Finalist A New York Times 10 Best Books of 2021 A Time 10 Best Nonfiction Books of 2021 Named a Best Book of 2021 by The New York Times, The Washington Post, The Boston Globe, The Economist, Smithsonian, Esquire, Entropy, The Christian Science Monitor, WBEZ\u0027s Nerdette Podcast, TeenVogue, GoodReads, SheReads, BookPage, Publishers Weekly, Kirkus, Fathom Magazine, the New York Public Library, and the Chicago Public Library One of GQ\u0027s 50 Best Books of Literary Journalism of the 21st Century Longlisted for the National Book Award Los Angeles Times, Best Nonfiction Gift One of President Obama\u0027s Favorite Books of 2021 This compelling #1 New York Times bestseller examines the legacy of slavery in America--and how both history and memory continue to shape our everyday lives. Beginning in his hometown of New Orleans, Clint Smith leads the reader on an unforgettable tour of monuments and landmarks--those that are honest about the past and those that are not--that offer an intergenerational story of how slavery has been central in shaping our nation\u0027s collective history, and ourselves. It is the story of the Monticello Plantation in Virginia, the estate where Thomas Jefferson wrote letters espousing the urgent need for liberty while enslaving more than four hundred people. It is the story of the Whitney Plantation, one of the only former plantations devoted to preserving the experience of the enslaved people whose lives and work sustained it. It is the story of Angola, a former plantation-turned-maximum-security prison in Louisiana that is filled with Black men who work across the 18,000-acre land for virtually no pay. And it is the story of Blandford Cemetery, the final resting place of tens of thousands of Confederate soldiers. A deeply researched and transporting exploration of the legacy of slavery and its imprint on centuries of American history, How the Word Is Passed illustrates how some of our country\u0027s most essential stories are hidden in plain view--whether in places we might drive by on our way to work, holidays such as Juneteenth, or entire neighborhoods like downtown Manhattan, where the brutal history of the trade in enslaved men, women, and children has been deeply imprinted. Informed by scholarship and brought to life by the story of people living today, Smith\u0027s debut work of nonfiction is a landmark of reflection and insight that offers a new understanding of the hopeful role that memory and history can play in making sense of our country and how it has come to be.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e", "custom_clean": 1, "custom_lists": [{"id": 5, "sort": "Must Read.2021 Time", "value": "Must Read.2021 Time"}], "custom_lists_ids": "5", "custom_read_date": null, "custom_reading_list": 0, "custom_types": "eBook", "flags": 1, "has_cover": 1, "id": 113, "identifier_ids": "374,376,375,377", "identifiers": [{"book": 113, "id": 377, "name": "ISBN", "path": "https://www.worldcat.org/isbn/9780316492935", "sort": "isbn", "type": "isbn", "val": "9780316492935"}, {"book": 113, "id": 375, "name": "Google Books", "path": "https://books.google.com/books?id=8pEHzgEACAAJ", "sort": "google", "type": "google", "val": "8pEHzgEACAAJ"}, {"book": 113, "id": 376, "name": "Goodreads", "path": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/55643287", "sort": "goodreads", "type": "goodreads", "val": "55643287"}, {"book": 113, "id": 374, "name": "Amazon", "path": "https://amazon.com/dp/0316492930", "sort": "amazon", "type": "amazon", "val": "0316492930"}], "isbn": "9780316492935", "language_ids": "1", "languages": [{"avg_rating": 8.429245283018869, "count": 341, "id": 1, "name": "ENG", "sort": "ENG"}], "last_modified": "2023-05-04 17:55:52.136675+00:00", "order_by": "2022-10-05 15:54:03.677102+00:00", "path": "Clint Smith/How the Word Is Passed_ A Reckoning (113)", "pubdate": "2021-06-01", "publisher_ids": "68", "publishers": [{"avg_rating": 8.5, "count": 4, "id": 68, "name": "Little, Brown and Company", "sort": "Little, Brown and Company"}], "rating": 5, "series": [], "series_ids": null, "size": 568333, "tag_ids": "57,60,194", "tags": [{"avg_rating": 8.333333333333334, "count": 40, "id": 194, "name": "Time", "sort": 40}, {"avg_rating": 8.363636363636363, "count": 24, "id": 60, "name": "History", "sort": 24}, {"avg_rating": 8.347826086956522, "count": 23, "id": 57, "name": "Politics", "sort": 23}], "timestamp": "2022-10-05 15:54:03.677102+00:00", "title": "How the Word Is Passed: A Reckoning With the History of Slavery Across America"}, {"author_ids": "114", "authors": [{"avg_rating": 10.0, "count": 1, "id": 114, "name": "Andrea Elliott", "sort": "Elliott, Andrea"}], "comments": "\u003cdiv\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn Invisible Child, Pulitzer Prize winner Andrea Elliott follows eight dramatic years in the life of Dasani, a girl whose imagination is as soaring as the skyscrapers near her Brooklyn shelter.

As our nation verges on recognizing June 19 as a national holiday, On Juneteenth is both an essential account and a stark reminder that the fight for equality is exigent and ongoing. 2 black-and-white illustrations\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e", "custom_clean": 1, "custom_lists": [{"id": 5, "sort": "Must Read.2021 Time", "value": "Must Read.2021 Time"}], "custom_lists_ids": "5", "custom_read_date": null, "custom_reading_list": 0, "custom_types": "eBook", "flags": 1, "has_cover": 1, "id": 111, "identifier_ids": "365,368,366,367", "identifiers": [{"book": 111, "id": 367, "name": "ISBN", "path": "https://www.worldcat.org/isbn/9781631498848", "sort": "isbn", "type": "isbn", "val": "9781631498848"}, {"book": 111, "id": 366, "name": "Google Books", "path": "https://books.google.com/books?id=FwwDEAAAQBAJ", "sort": "google", "type": "google", "val": "FwwDEAAAQBAJ"}, {"book": 111, "id": 368, "name": "Goodreads", "path": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/55298325", "sort": "goodreads", "type": "goodreads", "val": "55298325"}, {"book": 111, "id": 365, "name": "Amazon", "path": "https://amazon.com/dp/1631498835", "sort": "amazon", "type": "amazon", "val": "1631498835"}], "isbn": "9781631498848", "language_ids": "1", "languages": [{"avg_rating": 8.429245283018869, "count": 341, "id": 1, "name": "ENG", "sort": "ENG"}], "last_modified": "2022-10-06 17:40:33.417009+00:00", "order_by": "2022-10-05 15:54:02.651845+00:00", "path": "Annette Gordon-Reed/Unknown (111)", "pubdate": "2021-05-04", "publisher_ids": "84", "publishers": [{"avg_rating": 8.0, "count": 4, "id": 84, "name": "Liveright Publishing", "sort": "Liveright Publishing"}], "rating": 4, "series": [], "series_ids": null, "size": 700517, "tag_ids": "57,60,194", "tags": [{"avg_rating": 8.333333333333334, "count": 40, "id": 194, "name": "Time", "sort": 40}, {"avg_rating": 8.363636363636363, "count": 24, "id": 60, "name": "History", "sort": 24}, {"avg_rating": 8.347826086956522, "count": 23, "id": 57, "name": "Politics", "sort": 23}], "timestamp": "2022-10-05 15:54:02.651845+00:00", "title": "Unknown"}, {"author_ids": "49", "authors": [{"avg_rating": 8.0, "count": 1, "id": 49, "name": "Bob Altemeyer", "sort": "Altemeyer, Bob"}], "comments": "\u003cdiv\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBob Altemeyer - author of Atheists and The Authoritarian Specter - gives a readable analysis of the nature of authoritarianism and its current impact on American politics.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e", "custom_clean": 1, "custom_lists": [], "custom_lists_ids": null, "custom_read_date": null, "custom_reading_list": 0, "custom_types": "eBook", "flags": 1, "has_cover": 1, "id": 58, "identifier_ids": "54,53", "identifiers": [{"book": 58, "id": 53, "name": "Google Books", "path": "https://books.google.com/books?id=_YY5nQEACAAJ", "sort": "google", "type": "google", "val": "_YY5nQEACAAJ"}, {"book": 58, "id": 54, "name": "Goodreads", "path": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1971601", "sort": "goodreads", "type": "goodreads", "val": "1971601"}], "isbn": null, "language_ids": "1", "languages": [{"avg_rating": 8.429245283018869, "count": 341, "id": 1, "name": "ENG", "sort": "ENG"}], "last_modified": "2022-10-06 17:19:38.709950+00:00", "order_by": "2022-10-04 13:46:52.915000+00:00", "path": "Bob Altemeyer/The Authoritarians (58)", "pubdate": "2006-01-01", "publisher_ids": "26", "publishers": [{"avg_rating": 8.0, "count": 1, "id": 26, "name": "B.

Balls and soires, the burning of Moscow, the intrigues of statesmen and generals, scenes of violent battles, the quiet moments of everyday life--all in a work whose extraordinary imaginative power has never been surpassed. The Maudes\u0027 translation of Tolstoy\u0027s epic masterpiece has long been considered the best English version, and now for the first time it has been revised to bring it fully into line with modern approaches to the text. French passages are restored, Anglicization of Russian names removed, and outmoded expressions updated. A new introduction by Amy Mandelker considers the novel\u0027s literary and historical context, the nature of the work, and Tolstoy\u0027s artistic and philosophical aims.

Living Down and Out in Paris and London , repudiating respectable imperialist society, and reinventing himself as George Orwell. His 1933 debut book (ostensibly a novel, but overwhelmingly autobiographical) was rejected by that elitist publisher T. S. Eliot, perhaps because its close-up portrait of lowlife was too pungent for comfort.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn Paris, Orwell lived in verminous rooms and washed dishes at the overpriced \"Hotel X,\" in a remarkably filthy, 110-degree kitchen. He met \"eccentric people \u2013 people who have fallen into solitary, half-mad grooves of life and given up trying to be normal or decent.\" Though Orwell\u0027s tone is that of an outraged reformer, it\u0027s surprising how entertaining many of his adventures are: gnawing poverty only enlivens the imagination, and the wild characters he met often swindled each other and themselves. The wackiest tale involves a miser who ate cats, wore newspapers for underwear, invested 6,000 francs in cocaine, and hid it in a face-powder tin when the cops raided. They had to free him, because the apparently controlled substance turned out to be face powder instead of cocaine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn London, Orwell studied begging with a crippled expert named Bozo, a great storyteller and philosopher. Orwell devotes a chapter to the fine points of London guttersnipe slang. Years later, he would put his lexical bent to work by inventing Newspeak, and draw on his down-and-out experience to evoke the plight of the Proles in 1984. Though marred by hints of unexamined anti-Semitism, Orwell\u0027s debut remains, as The Nation put it, \"the most lucid portrait of poverty in the English language.\" --Tim Appelo\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e", "custom_clean": 1, "custom_lists": [], "custom_lists_ids": null, "custom_read_date": null, "custom_reading_list": 0, "custom_types": "eBook", "flags": 1, "has_cover": 1, "id": 159, "identifier_ids": "483,484,481,482", "identifiers": [{"book": 159, "id": 482, "name": "ISBN", "path": "https://www.worldcat.org/isbn/9780156262248", "sort": "isbn", "type": "isbn", "val": "9780156262248"}, {"book": 159, "id": 481, "name": "Google Books", "path": "https://books.google.com/books?id=m5vIVN7LjtgC", "sort": "google", "type": "google", "val": "m5vIVN7LjtgC"}, {"book": 159, "id": 484, "name": "Goodreads", "path": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34304872", "sort": "goodreads", "type": "goodreads", "val": "34304872"}, {"book": 159, "id": 483, "name": "Amazon", "path": "https://amazon.com/dp/015626224X", "sort": "amazon", "type": "amazon", "val": "015626224X"}], "isbn": "9780156262248", "language_ids": "1", "languages": [{"avg_rating": 8.429245283018869, "count": 341, "id": 1, "name": "ENG", "sort": "ENG"}], "last_modified": "2023-05-04 17:55:52.136675+00:00", "order_by": "2022-10-06 09:35:53.313990+00:00", "path": "George Orwell/Down and Out in Paris and London (159)", "pubdate": "1933-01-01", "publisher_ids": "90", "publishers": [{"avg_rating": 8.8, "count": 20, "id": 90, "name": "Penguin Random House", "sort": "Penguin Random House"}], "rating": 4, "series": [], "series_ids": null, "size": 690052, "tag_ids": "57,60,90,92,153", "tags": [{"avg_rating": 8.222222222222221, "count": 31, "id": 92, "name": "Biography", "sort": 31}, {"avg_rating": 8.578947368421053, "count": 28, "id": 153, "name": "Classics", "sort": 28}, {"avg_rating": 8.363636363636363, "count": 24, "id": 60, "name": "History", "sort": 24}, {"avg_rating": 8.347826086956522, "count": 23, "id": 57, "name": "Politics", "sort": 23}, {"avg_rating": 7.5, "count": 4, "id": 90, "name": "Travel", "sort": 4}], "timestamp": "2022-10-06 09:35:53.313990+00:00", "title": "Down and Out in Paris and London"}, {"author_ids": "161", "authors": [{"avg_rating": 8.0, "count": 1, "id": 161, "name": "Rutger Bregman", "sort": "Bregman, Rutger"}], "comments": "\u003cdiv\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDe mens is een beest, zeiden de koningen.

Sullivan, Jr., Washington Post From one of our top historians, a groundbreaking story of policing and \u201criots\u201d that shatters our understanding of the post\u2013civil rights era. What began in spring 2020 as local protests in response to the killing of George Floyd by Minneapolis police quickly exploded into a massive nationwide movement. Millions of mostly young people defiantly flooded into the nation\u2019s streets, demanding an end to police brutality and to the broader, systemic repression of Black people and other people of color. To many observers, the protests appeared to be without precedent in their scale and persistence. Yet, as the acclaimed historian Elizabeth Hinton demonstrates in America on Fire, the events of 2020 had clear precursors\u2014and any attempt to understand our current crisis requires a reckoning with the recent past. Even in the aftermath of Donald Trump, many Americans consider the decades since the civil rights movement in the mid-1960s as a story of progress toward greater inclusiveness and equality. Hinton\u2019s sweeping narrative uncovers an altogether different history, taking us on a troubling journey from Detroit in 1967 and Miami in 1980 to Los Angeles in 1992 and beyond to chart the persistence of structural racism and one of its primary consequences, the so-called urban riot. Hinton offers a critical corrective: the word riot was nothing less than a racist trope applied to events that can only be properly understood as rebellions\u2014explosions of collective resistance to an unequal and violent order. As she suggests, if rebellion and the conditions that precipitated it never disappeared, the optimistic story of a post\u2013Jim Crow United States no longer holds. Black rebellion, America on Fire powerfully illustrates, was born in response to poverty and exclusion, but most immediately in reaction to police violence. In 1968, President Lyndon Johnson launched the \u201cWar on Crime,\u201d sending militarized police forces into impoverished Black neighborhoods. Facing increasing surveillance and brutality, residents threw rocks and Molotov cocktails at officers, plundered local businesses, and vandalized exploitative institutions. Hinton draws on exclusive sources to uncover a previously hidden geography of violence in smaller American cities, from York, Pennsylvania, to Cairo, Illinois, to Stockton, California. The central lesson from these eruptions\u2014that police violence invariably leads to community violence\u2014continues to escape policymakers, who respond by further criminalizing entire groups instead of addressing underlying socioeconomic causes. The results are the hugely expanded policing and prison regimes that shape the lives of so many Americans today. Presenting a new framework for understanding our nation\u2019s enduring strife, America on Fire is also a warning: rebellions will surely continue unless police are no longer called on to manage the consequences of dismal conditions beyond their control, and until an oppressive system is finally remade on the principles of justice and equality.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e", "custom_clean": 1, "custom_lists": [{"id": 5, "sort": "Must Read.2021 Time", "value": "Must Read.2021 Time"}], "custom_lists_ids": "5", "custom_read_date": null, "custom_reading_list": 0, "custom_types": "eBook", "flags": 1, "has_cover": 1, "id": 144, "identifier_ids": "351,352,353", "identifiers": [{"book": 144, "id": 353, "name": "ISBN", "path": "https://www.worldcat.org/isbn/9781631498916", "sort": "isbn", "type": "isbn", "val": "9781631498916"}, {"book": 144, "id": 352, "name": "Google Books", "path": "https://books.google.com/books?id=PAwDEAAAQBAJ", "sort": "google", "type": "google", "val": "PAwDEAAAQBAJ"}, {"book": 144, "id": 351, "name": "Goodreads", "path": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/55298326", "sort": "goodreads", "type": "goodreads", "val": "55298326"}], "isbn": "9781631498916", "language_ids": "1", "languages": [{"avg_rating": 8.429245283018869, "count": 341, "id": 1, "name": "ENG", "sort": "ENG"}], "last_modified": "2023-05-04 17:55:52.136675+00:00", "order_by": "2022-10-05 15:54:15.142378+00:00", "path": "Elizabeth Hinton/America on Fire_ The Untold History (144)", "pubdate": "2021-05-18", "publisher_ids": "84", "publishers": [{"avg_rating": 8.0, "count": 4, "id": 84, "name": "Liveright Publishing", "sort": "Liveright Publishing"}], "rating": 4, "series": [], "series_ids": null, "size": 12900649, "tag_ids": "57,60,194", "tags": [{"avg_rating": 8.333333333333334, "count": 40, "id": 194, "name": "Time", "sort": 40}, {"avg_rating": 8.363636363636363, "count": 24, "id": 60, "name": "History", "sort": 24}, {"avg_rating": 8.347826086956522, "count": 23, "id": 57, "name": "Politics", "sort": 23}], "timestamp": "2022-10-05 15:54:15.142378+00:00", "title": "America on Fire: The Untold History of Police Violence and Black Rebellion Since the 1960s"}, {"author_ids": "145", "authors": [{"avg_rating": 8.0, "count": 1, "id": 145, "name": "Elizabeth Kolbert", "sort": "Kolbert, Elizabeth"}], "comments": "\u003cdiv\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNATIONAL BESTSELLER * The Pulitzer Prize-winning author of The Sixth Extinction returns to humanity\u0027s transformative impact on the environment, now asking: After doing so much damage, can we change nature, this time to save it?

So pervasive are human impacts on the planet that it\u0027s said we live in a new geological epoch: the Anthropocene. In Under a White Sky, Elizabeth Kolbert takes a hard look at the new world we are creating. Along the way, she meets biologists who are trying to preserve the world\u0027s rarest fish, which lives in a single tiny pool in the middle of the Mojave; engineers who are turning carbon emissions to stone in Iceland; Australian researchers who are trying to develop a \"super coral\" that can survive on a hotter globe; and physicists who are contemplating shooting tiny diamonds into the stratosphere to cool the earth. One way to look at human civilization, says Kolbert, is as a ten-thousand-year exercise in defying nature. In The Sixth Extinction, she explored the ways in which our capacity for destruction has reshaped the natural world. Now she examines how the very sorts of interventions that have imperiled our planet are increasingly seen as the only hope for its salvation. By turns inspiring, terrifying, and darkly comic, Under a White Sky is an utterly original examination of the challenges we face.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e", "custom_clean": 1, "custom_lists": [{"id": 5, "sort": "Must Read.2021 Time", "value": "Must Read.2021 Time"}], "custom_lists_ids": "5", "custom_read_date": null, "custom_reading_list": 0, "custom_types": "eBook", "flags": 1, "has_cover": 1, "id": 143, "identifier_ids": "462,461,460,459", "identifiers": [{"book": 143, "id": 459, "name": "ISBN", "path": "https://www.worldcat.org/isbn/9780593136287", "sort": "isbn", "type": "isbn", "val": "9780593136287"}, {"book": 143, "id": 460, "name": "Google Books", "path": "https://books.google.com/books?id=qwpjEAAAQBAJ", "sort": "google", "type": "google", "val": "qwpjEAAAQBAJ"}, {"book": 143, "id": 461, "name": "Goodreads", "path": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/60757903", "sort": "goodreads", "type": "goodreads", "val": "60757903"}, {"book": 143, "id": 462, "name": "Amazon", "path": "https://amazon.com/dp/B08DMWR6BP", "sort": "amazon", "type": "amazon", "val": "B08DMWR6BP"}], "isbn": "9780593136287", "language_ids": "1", "languages": [{"avg_rating": 8.429245283018869, "count": 341, "id": 1, "name": "ENG", "sort": "ENG"}], "last_modified": "2023-05-04 17:55:52.136675+00:00", "order_by": "2022-10-05 15:54:14.761371+00:00", "path": "Elizabeth Kolbert/Under a White Sky_ The Nature of th (143)", "pubdate": "2021-02-09", "publisher_ids": "100", "publishers": [{"avg_rating": 8.0, "count": 6, "id": 100, "name": "Crown Publishing Group", "sort": "Crown Publishing Group"}], "rating": 4, "series": [], "series_ids": null, "size": 4317039, "tag_ids": "57,58,60,125,194,253", "tags": [{"avg_rating": 8.333333333333334, "count": 40, "id": 194, "name": "Time", "sort": 40}, {"avg_rating": 8.363636363636363, "count": 24, "id": 60, "name": "History", "sort": 24}, {"avg_rating": 8.347826086956522, "count": 23, "id": 57, "name": "Politics", "sort": 23}, {"avg_rating": 8.222222222222221, "count": 11, "id": 58, "name": "Science", "sort": 11}, {"avg_rating": 8.0, "count": 2, "id": 253, "name": "Non-Fiction", "sort": 2}, {"avg_rating": 8.0, "count": 1, "id": 125, "name": "Climate Crisis", "sort": 1}], "timestamp": "2022-10-05 15:54:14.761371+00:00", "title": "Under a White Sky: The Nature of the Future"}, {"author_ids": "140", "authors": [{"avg_rating": 10.0, "count": 1, "id": 140, "name": "Heather McGhee", "sort": "McGhee, Heather"}], "comments": "\u003cdiv\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHeather McGhee\u0027s specialty is the American economy--and the mystery of why it so often fails the American public.

Nobody, including the lawmakers who passed the bill, expected it to transform the country\u2019s demographics. But over the next four decades, millions arrived, including Jay Caspian Kang\u2019s parents, grandparents, aunts, and uncles. They came with almost no understanding of their new home, much less the history of \u201cAsian America\u201d that was supposed to define them.\u00a0The Loneliest Americans is the unforgettable story of Kang and his family as they move from a housing project in Cambridge to an idyllic college town in the South and eventually to the West Coast. Their story unfolds against the backdrop of a rapidly expanding Asian America, as millions more immigrants, many of them working-class or undocumented, stream into the country.

It was also about ideas, in the broadest sense\u2014economic and political, artistic and personal. In The Free World, the acclaimed Pulitzer Prize\u2013winning scholar and critic Louis Menand tells the story of American culture in the pivotal years from the end of World War II to Vietnam and shows how changing economic, technological, and social forces put their mark on creations of the mind. How did elitism and an anti-totalitarian skepticism of passion and ideology give way to a new sensibility defined by freewheeling experimentation and loving the Beatles? How was the ideal of \u201cfreedom\u201d applied to causes that ranged from anti-communism and civil rights to radical acts of self-creation via art and even crime? With the wit and insight familiar to readers of The Metaphysical Club and his New Yorker essays, Menand takes us inside Hannah Arendt\u2019s Manhattan, the Paris of Jean-Paul Sartre and Simone de Beauvoir, Merce Cunningham and John Cage\u2019s residencies at North Carolina\u2019s Black Mountain College, and the Memphis studio where Sam Phillips and Elvis Presley created a new music for the American teenager. He examines the post war vogue for French existentialism, structuralism and post-structuralism, the rise of abstract expressionism and pop art, Allen Ginsberg\u2019s friendship with Lionel Trilling, James Baldwin\u2019s transformation into a Civil Right spokesman, Susan Sontag\u2019s challenges to the New York Intellectuals, the defeat of obscenity laws, and the rise of the New Hollywood. Stressing the rich flow of ideas across the Atlantic, he also shows how Europeans played a vital role in promoting and influencing American art and entertainment. By the end of the Vietnam era, the American government had lost the moral prestige it enjoyed at the end of the Second World War, but America\u2019s once-despised culture had become respected and adored. With unprecedented verve and range, this book explains how that happened.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e", "custom_clean": 1, "custom_lists": [{"id": 5, "sort": "Must Read.2021 Time", "value": "Must Read.2021 Time"}], "custom_lists_ids": "5", "custom_read_date": null, "custom_reading_list": 0, "custom_types": "eBook", "flags": 1, "has_cover": 1, "id": 132, "identifier_ids": "315,316,317", "identifiers": [{"book": 132, "id": 317, "name": "ISBN", "path": "https://www.worldcat.org/isbn/9780374722913", "sort": "isbn", "type": "isbn", "val": "9780374722913"}, {"book": 132, "id": 316, "name": "Google Books", "path": "https://books.google.com/books?id=rrziDwAAQBAJ", "sort": "google", "type": "google", "val": "rrziDwAAQBAJ"}, {"book": 132, "id": 315, "name": "Goodreads", "path": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/53317422", "sort": "goodreads", "type": "goodreads", "val": "53317422"}], "isbn": "9780374722913", "language_ids": "1", "languages": [{"avg_rating": 8.429245283018869, "count": 341, "id": 1, "name": "ENG", "sort": "ENG"}], "last_modified": "2023-05-04 17:55:52.136675+00:00", "order_by": "2022-10-05 15:54:10.771659+00:00", "path": "Louis Menand/The Free World_ Art and Thought in (132)", "pubdate": "2021-04-20", "publisher_ids": "71", "publishers": [{"avg_rating": 8.0, "count": 4, "id": 71, "name": "Farrar, Straus and Giroux", "sort": "Farrar, Straus and Giroux"}], "rating": 4, "series": [], "series_ids": null, "size": 35444855, "tag_ids": "44,57,60,62,132,194", "tags": [{"avg_rating": 8.333333333333334, "count": 40, "id": 194, "name": "Time", "sort": 40}, {"avg_rating": 8.363636363636363, "count": 24, "id": 60, "name": "History", "sort": 24}, {"avg_rating": 8.347826086956522, "count": 23, "id": 57, "name": "Politics", "sort": 23}, {"avg_rating": 7.833333333333333, "count": 12, "id": 62, "name": "Philosophy", "sort": 12}, {"avg_rating": 8.0, "count": 6, "id": 44, "name": "Art", "sort": 6}, {"avg_rating": 7.6, "count": 6, "id": 132, "name": "Music", "sort": 6}], "timestamp": "2022-10-05 15:54:10.771659+00:00", "title": "The Free World: Art and Thought in the Cold War"}, {"author_ids": "163", "authors": [{"avg_rating": 8.0, "count": 1, "id": 163, "name": "Weiwei Ai", "sort": "Ai, Weiwei"}], "comments": "\u003cdiv\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnce an intimate of Mao Zedong and the nation\u0027s most celebrated poet, Ai Weiwei\u0027s father, Ai Qing, was branded a rightist during the Cultural Revolution, and he and his family were banished to a desolate place known as \"Little Siberia,\" where Ai Qing was sentenced to hard labor cleaning public toilets.

As she shows, the murder of the Indigenous man set the entire mid-Atlantic on edge, with many believing war was imminent. Isolated killings often flared into colonial wars in North America, and colonists now anticipated a vengeful Indigenous uprising. Frantic efforts to resolve the case ignited a dramatic, far-reaching debate between Native American forms of justice\u2014centered on community, forgiveness, and reparations\u2014and an ideology of harsh reprisal, unique to the colonies and based on British law, which called for the killers\u2019 swift execution.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn charting the far-reaching ramifications of the murder, Covered with Night \u2014a phrase from Iroquois mourning practices\u2014overturns persistent assumptions about \u201ccivilized\u201d Europeans and \u201csavage\u201d Native Americans. As Eustace powerfully contends, the colonial obsession with \u201ccivility\u201d belied the reality that the Iroquois, far from being the barbarians of the white imagination, acted under a mantle of sophistication and humanity as they tried to make the land- and power-hungry colonials understand their ways. In truth, Eustace reveals, the Iroquois\u2014the Six Nations of the Haudenosaunee, as they are known today\u2014saw the killing as an opportunity to forge stronger bonds with the colonists.

From the prize-winning and bestselling author of Say Nothing The history of the Sackler dynasty is rife with drama\u2014baroque personal lives; bitter disputes over estates; fistfights in boardrooms; glittering art collections; Machiavellian courtroom maneuvers; and the calculated use of money to burnish reputations and crush the less powerful.\u00a0The Sackler name has adorned the walls of many storied institutions\u2014Harvard, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Oxford, the Louvre. They are one of the richest families in the world, known for their lavish donations to the arts and the sciences. The source of the family fortune was vague, however, until it emerged that the Sacklers were responsible for making and marketing a blockbuster painkiller that was the catalyst for the opioid crisis. Empire of Pain begins with the story of three doctor brothers, Raymond, Mortimer and the incalculably energetic Arthur, who weathered the poverty of the Great Depression and appalling anti-Semitism. Working at a barbaric mental institution, Arthur saw a better way and conducted groundbreaking research into drug treatments. He also had a genius for marketing, especially for pharmaceuticals, and bought a small ad firm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eArthur devised the marketing for Valium, and built the first great Sackler fortune. He purchased a drug manufacturer, Purdue Frederick, which would be run by Raymond and Mortimer. The brothers began collecting art, and wives, and grand residences in exotic locales. Their children and grandchildren grew up in luxury.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eForty years later, Raymond\u2019s son Richard ran the family-owned Purdue. The template Arthur Sackler created to sell Valium\u2014co-opting doctors, influencing the FDA, downplaying the drug\u2019s addictiveness\u2014was employed to launch a far more potent product: OxyContin. The drug went on to generate some thirty-five billion dollars in revenue, and to launch a public health crisis in which hundreds of thousands would die. This is the saga of three generations of a single family and the mark they would leave on the world, a tale that moves from the bustling streets of early twentieth-century Brooklyn to the seaside palaces\u00a0of Greenwich, Connecticut, and Cap d\u2019Antibes to the corridors of power in Washington, D.C.\u00a0 Empire of Pain chronicles the multiple investigations of the Sacklers and their company, and the scorched-earth legal tactics that the family has used to evade accountability.\u00a0Empire of Pain is a masterpiece of narrative reporting and writing, exhaustively documented and ferociously compelling. It is a portrait of the excesses of America\u2019s second Gilded Age, a study of impunity among the super elite and a relentless investigation of the naked greed and indifference to human suffering that built one of the world\u2019s great fortunes.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e", "custom_clean": 1, "custom_lists": [{"id": 5, "sort": "Must Read.2021 Time", "value": "Must Read.2021 Time"}], "custom_lists_ids": "5", "custom_read_date": null, "custom_reading_list": 0, "custom_types": "eBook", "flags": 1, "has_cover": 1, "id": 124, "identifier_ids": "408,406,407", "identifiers": [{"book": 124, "id": 407, "name": "ISBN", "path": "https://www.worldcat.org/isbn/9780385545693", "sort": "isbn", "type": "isbn", "val": "9780385545693"}, {"book": 124, "id": 406, "name": "Google Books", "path": "https://books.google.com/books?id=Qb4IEAAAQBAJ", "sort": "google", "type": "google", "val": "Qb4IEAAAQBAJ"}, {"book": 124, "id": 408, "name": "Goodreads", "path": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43868109", "sort": "goodreads", "type": "goodreads", "val": "43868109"}], "isbn": "9780385545693", "language_ids": "1", "languages": [{"avg_rating": 8.429245283018869, "count": 341, "id": 1, "name": "ENG", "sort": "ENG"}], "last_modified": "2023-05-04 17:55:52.136675+00:00", "order_by": "2022-10-05 15:54:07.602947+00:00", "path": "Patrick Radden Keefe/Empire of Pain_ The Secret History (124)", "pubdate": "2021-04-13", "publisher_ids": "82", "publishers": [{"avg_rating": 8.5, "count": 5, "id": 82, "name": "Knopf Publishing Group", "sort": "Knopf Publishing Group"}], "rating": 5, "series": [], "series_ids": null, "size": 5759595, "tag_ids": "51,57,58,60,92,194", "tags": [{"avg_rating": 8.333333333333334, "count": 40, "id": 194, "name": "Time", "sort": 40}, {"avg_rating": 8.222222222222221, "count": 31, "id": 92, "name": "Biography", "sort": 31}, {"avg_rating": 8.363636363636363, "count": 24, "id": 60, "name": "History", "sort": 24}, {"avg_rating": 8.347826086956522, "count": 23, "id": 57, "name": "Politics", "sort": 23}, {"avg_rating": 8.2, "count": 11, "id": 51, "name": "Business", "sort": 11}, {"avg_rating": 8.222222222222221, "count": 11, "id": 58, "name": "Science", "sort": 11}], "timestamp": "2022-10-05 15:54:07.602947+00:00", "title": "Empire of Pain: The Secret History of the Sackler Dynasty"}, {"author_ids": "115", "authors": [{"avg_rating": 10.0, "count": 1, "id": 115, "name": "Clint Smith", "sort": "Smith, Clint"}], "comments": "\u003cdiv\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInstant #1 New York Times Bestseller Winner of the National Book Critics Circle Award for Nonfiction Winner of the Stowe Prize Winner of 2022 Hillman Prize for Book Journalism PEN America 2022 John Kenneth Galbraith Award for Nonfiction Finalist A New York Times 10 Best Books of 2021 A Time 10 Best Nonfiction Books of 2021 Named a Best Book of 2021 by The New York Times, The Washington Post, The Boston Globe, The Economist, Smithsonian, Esquire, Entropy, The Christian Science Monitor, WBEZ\u0027s Nerdette Podcast, TeenVogue, GoodReads, SheReads, BookPage, Publishers Weekly, Kirkus, Fathom Magazine, the New York Public Library, and the Chicago Public Library One of GQ\u0027s 50 Best Books of Literary Journalism of the 21st Century Longlisted for the National Book Award Los Angeles Times, Best Nonfiction Gift One of President Obama\u0027s Favorite Books of 2021 This compelling #1 New York Times bestseller examines the legacy of slavery in America--and how both history and memory continue to shape our everyday lives. Beginning in his hometown of New Orleans, Clint Smith leads the reader on an unforgettable tour of monuments and landmarks--those that are honest about the past and those that are not--that offer an intergenerational story of how slavery has been central in shaping our nation\u0027s collective history, and ourselves. It is the story of the Monticello Plantation in Virginia, the estate where Thomas Jefferson wrote letters espousing the urgent need for liberty while enslaving more than four hundred people. It is the story of the Whitney Plantation, one of the only former plantations devoted to preserving the experience of the enslaved people whose lives and work sustained it. It is the story of Angola, a former plantation-turned-maximum-security prison in Louisiana that is filled with Black men who work across the 18,000-acre land for virtually no pay. And it is the story of Blandford Cemetery, the final resting place of tens of thousands of Confederate soldiers. A deeply researched and transporting exploration of the legacy of slavery and its imprint on centuries of American history, How the Word Is Passed illustrates how some of our country\u0027s most essential stories are hidden in plain view--whether in places we might drive by on our way to work, holidays such as Juneteenth, or entire neighborhoods like downtown Manhattan, where the brutal history of the trade in enslaved men, women, and children has been deeply imprinted. Informed by scholarship and brought to life by the story of people living today, Smith\u0027s debut work of nonfiction is a landmark of reflection and insight that offers a new understanding of the hopeful role that memory and history can play in making sense of our country and how it has come to be.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e", "custom_clean": 1, "custom_lists": [{"id": 5, "sort": "Must Read.2021 Time", "value": "Must Read.2021 Time"}], "custom_lists_ids": "5", "custom_read_date": null, "custom_reading_list": 0, "custom_types": "eBook", "flags": 1, "has_cover": 1, "id": 113, "identifier_ids": "374,376,375,377", "identifiers": [{"book": 113, "id": 377, "name": "ISBN", "path": "https://www.worldcat.org/isbn/9780316492935", "sort": "isbn", "type": "isbn", "val": "9780316492935"}, {"book": 113, "id": 375, "name": "Google Books", "path": "https://books.google.com/books?id=8pEHzgEACAAJ", "sort": "google", "type": "google", "val": "8pEHzgEACAAJ"}, {"book": 113, "id": 376, "name": "Goodreads", "path": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/55643287", "sort": "goodreads", "type": "goodreads", "val": "55643287"}, {"book": 113, "id": 374, "name": "Amazon", "path": "https://amazon.com/dp/0316492930", "sort": "amazon", "type": "amazon", "val": "0316492930"}], "isbn": "9780316492935", "language_ids": "1", "languages": [{"avg_rating": 8.429245283018869, "count": 341, "id": 1, "name": "ENG", "sort": "ENG"}], "last_modified": "2023-05-04 17:55:52.136675+00:00", "order_by": "2022-10-05 15:54:03.677102+00:00", "path": "Clint Smith/How the Word Is Passed_ A Reckoning (113)", "pubdate": "2021-06-01", "publisher_ids": "68", "publishers": [{"avg_rating": 8.5, "count": 4, "id": 68, "name": "Little, Brown and Company", "sort": "Little, Brown and Company"}], "rating": 5, "series": [], "series_ids": null, "size": 568333, "tag_ids": "57,60,194", "tags": [{"avg_rating": 8.333333333333334, "count": 40, "id": 194, "name": "Time", "sort": 40}, {"avg_rating": 8.363636363636363, "count": 24, "id": 60, "name": "History", "sort": 24}, {"avg_rating": 8.347826086956522, "count": 23, "id": 57, "name": "Politics", "sort": 23}], "timestamp": "2022-10-05 15:54:03.677102+00:00", "title": "How the Word Is Passed: A Reckoning With the History of Slavery Across America"}, {"author_ids": "114", "authors": [{"avg_rating": 10.0, "count": 1, "id": 114, "name": "Andrea Elliott", "sort": "Elliott, Andrea"}], "comments": "\u003cdiv\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn Invisible Child, Pulitzer Prize winner Andrea Elliott follows eight dramatic years in the life of Dasani, a girl whose imagination is as soaring as the skyscrapers near her Brooklyn shelter.

As our nation verges on recognizing June 19 as a national holiday, On Juneteenth is both an essential account and a stark reminder that the fight for equality is exigent and ongoing. 2 black-and-white illustrations\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e", "custom_clean": 1, "custom_lists": [{"id": 5, "sort": "Must Read.2021 Time", "value": "Must Read.2021 Time"}], "custom_lists_ids": "5", "custom_read_date": null, "custom_reading_list": 0, "custom_types": "eBook", "flags": 1, "has_cover": 1, "id": 111, "identifier_ids": "365,368,366,367", "identifiers": [{"book": 111, "id": 367, "name": "ISBN", "path": "https://www.worldcat.org/isbn/9781631498848", "sort": "isbn", "type": "isbn", "val": "9781631498848"}, {"book": 111, "id": 366, "name": "Google Books", "path": "https://books.google.com/books?id=FwwDEAAAQBAJ", "sort": "google", "type": "google", "val": "FwwDEAAAQBAJ"}, {"book": 111, "id": 368, "name": "Goodreads", "path": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/55298325", "sort": "goodreads", "type": "goodreads", "val": "55298325"}, {"book": 111, "id": 365, "name": "Amazon", "path": "https://amazon.com/dp/1631498835", "sort": "amazon", "type": "amazon", "val": "1631498835"}], "isbn": "9781631498848", "language_ids": "1", "languages": [{"avg_rating": 8.429245283018869, "count": 341, "id": 1, "name": "ENG", "sort": "ENG"}], "last_modified": "2022-10-06 17:40:33.417009+00:00", "order_by": "2022-10-05 15:54:02.651845+00:00", "path": "Annette Gordon-Reed/Unknown (111)", "pubdate": "2021-05-04", "publisher_ids": "84", "publishers": [{"avg_rating": 8.0, "count": 4, "id": 84, "name": "Liveright Publishing", "sort": "Liveright Publishing"}], "rating": 4, "series": [], "series_ids": null, "size": 700517, "tag_ids": "57,60,194", "tags": [{"avg_rating": 8.333333333333334, "count": 40, "id": 194, "name": "Time", "sort": 40}, {"avg_rating": 8.363636363636363, "count": 24, "id": 60, "name": "History", "sort": 24}, {"avg_rating": 8.347826086956522, "count": 23, "id": 57, "name": "Politics", "sort": 23}], "timestamp": "2022-10-05 15:54:02.651845+00:00", "title": "Unknown"}, {"author_ids": "49", "authors": [{"avg_rating": 8.0, "count": 1, "id": 49, "name": "Bob Altemeyer", "sort": "Altemeyer, Bob"}], "comments": "\u003cdiv\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBob Altemeyer - author of Atheists and The Authoritarian Specter - gives a readable analysis of the nature of authoritarianism and its current impact on American politics.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e", "custom_clean": 1, "custom_lists": [], "custom_lists_ids": null, "custom_read_date": null, "custom_reading_list": 0, "custom_types": "eBook", "flags": 1, "has_cover": 1, "id": 58, "identifier_ids": "54,53", "identifiers": [{"book": 58, "id": 53, "name": "Google Books", "path": "https://books.google.com/books?id=_YY5nQEACAAJ", "sort": "google", "type": "google", "val": "_YY5nQEACAAJ"}, {"book": 58, "id": 54, "name": "Goodreads", "path": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1971601", "sort": "goodreads", "type": "goodreads", "val": "1971601"}], "isbn": null, "language_ids": "1", "languages": [{"avg_rating": 8.429245283018869, "count": 341, "id": 1, "name": "ENG", "sort": "ENG"}], "last_modified": "2022-10-06 17:19:38.709950+00:00", "order_by": "2022-10-04 13:46:52.915000+00:00", "path": "Bob Altemeyer/The Authoritarians (58)", "pubdate": "2006-01-01", "publisher_ids": "26", "publishers": [{"avg_rating": 8.0, "count": 1, "id": 26, "name": "B.

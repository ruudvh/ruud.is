Among them: a successful, first generation Chinese immigrant musician suffering sexual dysfunction; a young woman whose father abandoned her at age nine with her younger siblings in an isolated cottage in the depth of winter; and a glamorous workaholic whose narcissistic, negligent mother greeted her each morning of her childhood with \"Good morning, Monster.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEach patient presents a mystery, one that will only be unpacked over years.

An acronym for \"Phenethylamines I Have Known and Loved\", the book spans autobiography, organic chemistry, politics, ethnobotany, and psychopharmacology, and the cultural impact is likely to be profound for decades to come, as it has already. PiHKAL is divided into two parts, the first of which is a fictionalized autobiographical \u0027novel\u0027 - the main fiction is that it is fiction. This first half of the book is The Love Story, about two people named Shura and Alice who fall in love, though one of them is already in love with someone else. This love triangle is a painful ordeal they must go through, and that process unfolds before the reader with grace and great insight into human nature. Shura is a brilliant chemist who has dedicated his career to making psychoactive drugs, in the story they go through many experiences with the psychedelic compounds that Shura has discovered and has made in his lab, all of which have been bioassayed himself. The reader will find themselves going on this journey with them, experiencing what they experienced, both in their hearts and in the psychedelic journeys they have. The second half of PiHKAL is called The Chemical Story, and it contains detailed instructions for, and effects of, the synthesis of 179 psychedelic phenethylamines which were mostly discovered by Shulgin himself. For each substance there is information on its synthesis, suggested effective dosage, duration, and detailed commentary on the subjective effects that were experienced. This book appeals to adults of all ages and cultures, and to the psychedelically experienced and inexperienced alike.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e", "custom_clean": 1, "custom_lists": [], "custom_lists_ids": null, "custom_read_date": null, "custom_reading_list": 1, "custom_types": [{"id": 1, "sort": "eBook", "value": "eBook"}], "custom_types_ids": "1", "flags": 1, "has_cover": 1, "id": 252, "identifier_ids": "864,865,863", "identifiers": [{"book": 252, "id": 863, "name": "ISBN", "path": "https://www.worldcat.org/isbn/9780963009609", "sort": "isbn", "type": "isbn", "val": "9780963009609"}, {"book": 252, "id": 865, "name": "Google Books", "path": "https://books.google.com/books?id=O8AdHBGybpcC", "sort": "google", "type": "google", "val": "O8AdHBGybpcC"}, {"book": 252, "id": 864, "name": "Goodreads", "path": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/886113", "sort": "goodreads", "type": "goodreads", "val": "886113"}], "isbn": "9780963009609", "language_ids": "1", "languages": [{"avg_rating": 8.3717277486911, "count": 276, "id": 1, "name": "ENG", "sort": "ENG"}], "last_modified": "2023-03-25 22:02:03.254144+00:00", "order_by": "2023-01-03 18:10:07.521546+00:00", "path": "Alexander Shulgin/Pihkal_ A Chemical Love Story (252)", "pubdate": "1990-10-01", "publisher_ids": "153", "publishers": [{"avg_rating": 8.0, "count": 1, "id": 153, "name": "Transform Press", "sort": "Transform Press"}], "rating": 4, "series": [], "series_ids": null, "size": 1271874, "tag_ids": "43,92,239,241,242", "tags": [{"avg_rating": 8.222222222222221, "count": 31, "id": 92, "name": "Biography", "sort": 31}, {"avg_rating": 8.0, "count": 27, "id": 43, "name": "Self Help", "sort": 27}, {"avg_rating": 8.0, "count": 1, "id": 239, "name": "Personal Memoirs", "sort": 1}, {"avg_rating": 8.0, "count": 1, "id": 241, "name": "Substance Abuse \u0026 Addictions", "sort": 1}, {"avg_rating": 8.0, "count": 1, "id": 242, "name": "Drugs", "sort": 1}], "timestamp": "2023-01-03 18:10:07.521546+00:00", "title": "Pihkal: A Chemical Love Story"}, {"author_ids": "335", "authors": [{"avg_rating": 8.0, "count": 1, "id": 335, "name": "Tony Fadell", "sort": "Fadell, Tony"}], "comments": "\u003cdiv\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWritten for anyone who wants to grow at work\u2014from young grads navigating their first jobs to CEOs deciding whether to sell their company\u2014 Build is full of personal stories, practical advice and fascinating insights into some of the most impactful products and people of the 20th century.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEach quick 5-20 page entry builds on the previous one, charting Tony\u2019s personal journey from a product designer to a leader, from a startup founder to an executive to a mentor.

It Doesn\u0027t Have to Be Crazy at Work is a direct successor to Rework, the instant bestseller that showed readers a new path to working effectively. Now Fried and Heinemeier Hansson have returned with a new strategy for the ideal company culture - what they call the calm company . It is a direct attack on the chaos, anxiety and stress that plagues millions of workplaces and billions of people working their day jobs. Working to breaking point with long hours, excessive workload, and a lack of sleep have become a badge of honour for many people these days, when it should be a mark of stupidity. This isn\u0027t just a problem for large organisations; individuals, contractors and solopreneurs are burning themselves out in the very same way. As the authors reveal, the answer isn\u0027t more hours. Rather, it\u0027s less waste and fewer things that induce distraction, always-on anxiety and stress. It is time to stop celebrating crazy and start celebrating calm. Fried and Hansson have the proof to back up their argument. Calm has been the cornerstone of their company\u0027s culture since Basecamp began twenty years ago.

When we bring both respect and interpersonal savvy to our work relationships, we do more than make people feel good. We enhance personal and organizational performance. And as the workplace grows more complex and competitive, managing our work relationships becomes even more essential and difficult. Now more than ever we need to work people smart. Working PeopleSmart describes the six core strategies used by people-smart individuals and shows how to apply them in the toughest workplace situations. Individuals who are people smart know how to open others up rather than make them defensive or resistant. They have a knack for diffusing tension rather than creating it. They set a good example through their own behavior on the job and can inspire and influence others with less developed skills. Working PeopleSmart can serve as your virtual coach to guide you through difficult work relationships skillfully. How do you deal with a critical colleague? Make your boss listen to you? React to an offensive joke? Get the resources you need? The authors look at over 50 real-life situations and offer people-smart prescriptions for handling them effectively. They provide coaching tips for each scenario and describe exactly what a people-smart response sounds like. As two psychologists with both organizational and clinical expertise, coauthors Mel Silberman and Freda Hansburg are highly qualified to deliver the message that we can emerge from even the toughest interpersonal moments on the job with dignity and grace. Where other books rely on typologies that categorize people according to their interpersonal styles and then offer advice on how to deal with each type, the strategies described in Working PeopleSmart are straightforward and universal. They can be used immediately to deal with any type of person or any situation, no matter how difficult or sensitive.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e", "custom_clean": 1, "custom_lists": [], "custom_lists_ids": null, "custom_read_date": null, "custom_reading_list": 0, "custom_types": [{"id": 1, "sort": "eBook", "value": "eBook"}], "custom_types_ids": "1", "flags": 1, "has_cover": 1, "id": 34, "identifier_ids": "122,121,123", "identifiers": [{"book": 34, "id": 123, "name": "ISBN", "path": "https://www.worldcat.org/isbn/9781576752081", "sort": "isbn", "type": "isbn", "val": "9781576752081"}, {"book": 34, "id": 121, "name": "Google Books", "path": "https://books.google.com/books?id=YZgNngEACAAJ", "sort": "google", "type": "google", "val": "YZgNngEACAAJ"}, {"book": 34, "id": 122, "name": "Goodreads", "path": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1946690", "sort": "goodreads", "type": "goodreads", "val": "1946690"}], "isbn": "9781576752081", "language_ids": "1", "languages": [{"avg_rating": 8.3717277486911, "count": 276, "id": 1, "name": "ENG", "sort": "ENG"}], "last_modified": "2022-10-06 17:19:38.709950+00:00", "order_by": "2022-10-04 13:46:41.441000+00:00", "path": "Melvin L.

Among them: a successful, first generation Chinese immigrant musician suffering sexual dysfunction; a young woman whose father abandoned her at age nine with her younger siblings in an isolated cottage in the depth of winter; and a glamorous workaholic whose narcissistic, negligent mother greeted her each morning of her childhood with \"Good morning, Monster.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEach patient presents a mystery, one that will only be unpacked over years.

An acronym for \"Phenethylamines I Have Known and Loved\", the book spans autobiography, organic chemistry, politics, ethnobotany, and psychopharmacology, and the cultural impact is likely to be profound for decades to come, as it has already. PiHKAL is divided into two parts, the first of which is a fictionalized autobiographical \u0027novel\u0027 - the main fiction is that it is fiction. This first half of the book is The Love Story, about two people named Shura and Alice who fall in love, though one of them is already in love with someone else. This love triangle is a painful ordeal they must go through, and that process unfolds before the reader with grace and great insight into human nature. Shura is a brilliant chemist who has dedicated his career to making psychoactive drugs, in the story they go through many experiences with the psychedelic compounds that Shura has discovered and has made in his lab, all of which have been bioassayed himself. The reader will find themselves going on this journey with them, experiencing what they experienced, both in their hearts and in the psychedelic journeys they have. The second half of PiHKAL is called The Chemical Story, and it contains detailed instructions for, and effects of, the synthesis of 179 psychedelic phenethylamines which were mostly discovered by Shulgin himself. For each substance there is information on its synthesis, suggested effective dosage, duration, and detailed commentary on the subjective effects that were experienced. This book appeals to adults of all ages and cultures, and to the psychedelically experienced and inexperienced alike.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e", "custom_clean": 1, "custom_lists": [], "custom_lists_ids": null, "custom_read_date": null, "custom_reading_list": 1, "custom_types": [{"id": 1, "sort": "eBook", "value": "eBook"}], "custom_types_ids": "1", "flags": 1, "has_cover": 1, "id": 252, "identifier_ids": "864,865,863", "identifiers": [{"book": 252, "id": 863, "name": "ISBN", "path": "https://www.worldcat.org/isbn/9780963009609", "sort": "isbn", "type": "isbn", "val": "9780963009609"}, {"book": 252, "id": 865, "name": "Google Books", "path": "https://books.google.com/books?id=O8AdHBGybpcC", "sort": "google", "type": "google", "val": "O8AdHBGybpcC"}, {"book": 252, "id": 864, "name": "Goodreads", "path": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/886113", "sort": "goodreads", "type": "goodreads", "val": "886113"}], "isbn": "9780963009609", "language_ids": "1", "languages": [{"avg_rating": 8.3717277486911, "count": 276, "id": 1, "name": "ENG", "sort": "ENG"}], "last_modified": "2023-03-25 22:02:03.254144+00:00", "order_by": "2023-01-03 18:10:07.521546+00:00", "path": "Alexander Shulgin/Pihkal_ A Chemical Love Story (252)", "pubdate": "1990-10-01", "publisher_ids": "153", "publishers": [{"avg_rating": 8.0, "count": 1, "id": 153, "name": "Transform Press", "sort": "Transform Press"}], "rating": 4, "series": [], "series_ids": null, "size": 1271874, "tag_ids": "43,92,239,241,242", "tags": [{"avg_rating": 8.222222222222221, "count": 31, "id": 92, "name": "Biography", "sort": 31}, {"avg_rating": 8.0, "count": 27, "id": 43, "name": "Self Help", "sort": 27}, {"avg_rating": 8.0, "count": 1, "id": 239, "name": "Personal Memoirs", "sort": 1}, {"avg_rating": 8.0, "count": 1, "id": 241, "name": "Substance Abuse \u0026 Addictions", "sort": 1}, {"avg_rating": 8.0, "count": 1, "id": 242, "name": "Drugs", "sort": 1}], "timestamp": "2023-01-03 18:10:07.521546+00:00", "title": "Pihkal: A Chemical Love Story"}, {"author_ids": "335", "authors": [{"avg_rating": 8.0, "count": 1, "id": 335, "name": "Tony Fadell", "sort": "Fadell, Tony"}], "comments": "\u003cdiv\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWritten for anyone who wants to grow at work\u2014from young grads navigating their first jobs to CEOs deciding whether to sell their company\u2014 Build is full of personal stories, practical advice and fascinating insights into some of the most impactful products and people of the 20th century.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEach quick 5-20 page entry builds on the previous one, charting Tony\u2019s personal journey from a product designer to a leader, from a startup founder to an executive to a mentor.

It Doesn\u0027t Have to Be Crazy at Work is a direct successor to Rework, the instant bestseller that showed readers a new path to working effectively. Now Fried and Heinemeier Hansson have returned with a new strategy for the ideal company culture - what they call the calm company . It is a direct attack on the chaos, anxiety and stress that plagues millions of workplaces and billions of people working their day jobs. Working to breaking point with long hours, excessive workload, and a lack of sleep have become a badge of honour for many people these days, when it should be a mark of stupidity. This isn\u0027t just a problem for large organisations; individuals, contractors and solopreneurs are burning themselves out in the very same way. As the authors reveal, the answer isn\u0027t more hours. Rather, it\u0027s less waste and fewer things that induce distraction, always-on anxiety and stress. It is time to stop celebrating crazy and start celebrating calm. Fried and Hansson have the proof to back up their argument. Calm has been the cornerstone of their company\u0027s culture since Basecamp began twenty years ago. Destined to become the management guide for the next generation, It Doesn\u0027t Have to Be Crazy at Work is a practical and inspiring distillation of their insights and experiences. It isn\u0027t a book telling you what to do. It\u0027s a book showing you what they\u0027ve done-and how any manager or executive no matter the industry or size of the company, can do it too.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e", "custom_clean": 1, "custom_lists": [], "custom_lists_ids": null, "custom_read_date": null, "custom_reading_list": 0, "custom_types": [{"id": 1, "sort": "eBook", "value": "eBook"}], "custom_types_ids": "1", "flags": 1, "has_cover": 1, "id": 57, "identifier_ids": "594,596,592,593,595", "identifiers": [{"book": 57, "id": 595, "name": "ISBN", "path": "https://www.worldcat.org/isbn/9780062874795", "sort": "isbn", "type": "isbn", "val": "9780062874795"}, {"book": 57, "id": 593, "name": "Google Books", "path": "https://books.google.com/books?id=aOlMDwAAQBAJ", "sort": "google", "type": "google", "val": "aOlMDwAAQBAJ"}, {"book": 57, "id": 592, "name": "Goodreads", "path": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39674332", "sort": "goodreads", "type": "goodreads", "val": "39674332"}, {"book": 57, "id": 596, "name": "Barnes \u0026 Noble", "path": "https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/it-doesnt-have-to-be-crazy-at-work-jason-fried/1128018111", "sort": "barnesnoble", "type": "barnesnoble", "val": "w/it-doesnt-have-to-be-crazy-at-work-jason-fried/1128018111"}, {"book": 57, "id": 594, "name": "Amazon", "path": "https://amazon.com/dp/0062874780", "sort": "amazon", "type": "amazon", "val": "0062874780"}], "isbn": "9780062874795", "language_ids": "1", "languages": [{"avg_rating": 8.3717277486911, "count": 276, "id": 1, "name": "ENG", "sort": "ENG"}], "last_modified": "2022-10-06 17:19:38.709950+00:00", "order_by": "2022-10-04 13:46:52.016000+00:00", "path": "Jason Fried/It Doesn\u0027t Have to Be Crazy at Work (57)", "pubdate": "2018-10-02", "publisher_ids": "32", "publishers": [{"avg_rating": 9.0, "count": 20, "id": 32, "name": "HarperCollins", "sort": "HarperCollins"}], "rating": 4, "series": [], "series_ids": null, "size": 2765822, "tag_ids": "43,51", "tags": [{"avg_rating": 8.0, "count": 27, "id": 43, "name": "Self Help", "sort": 27}, {"avg_rating": 8.363636363636363, "count": 12, "id": 51, "name": "Business", "sort": 12}], "timestamp": "2022-10-04 13:46:52.016000+00:00", "title": "It Doesn\u0027t Have to Be Crazy at Work"}, {"author_ids": "60,85", "authors": [{"avg_rating": 6.0, "count": 1, "id": 60, "name": "Richard Nelson Bolles", "sort": "Bolles, Richard Nelson"}, {"avg_rating": 6.0, "count": 1, "id": 85, "name": "Katharine Brooks", "sort": "Brooks, Katharine"}], "comments": "\u003cdiv\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith timeless advice, up-to-the-minute insights, and more than ten million copies sold over fifty years, the world\u2019s most popular and best-selling career guide is fully revised and expanded for 2021.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn today\u2019s challenging job-market, as recent grads face a shifting economic landscape and seek work that pays and inspires, as workers are laid off mid-career, and as people search for an inspiring work-life change, the time-tested advice of What Color Is Your Parachute? is needed more than ever.

When we bring both respect and interpersonal savvy to our work relationships, we do more than make people feel good. We enhance personal and organizational performance. And as the workplace grows more complex and competitive, managing our work relationships becomes even more essential and difficult. Now more than ever we need to work people smart. Working PeopleSmart describes the six core strategies used by people-smart individuals and shows how to apply them in the toughest workplace situations. Individuals who are people smart know how to open others up rather than make them defensive or resistant. They have a knack for diffusing tension rather than creating it. They set a good example through their own behavior on the job and can inspire and influence others with less developed skills. Working PeopleSmart can serve as your virtual coach to guide you through difficult work relationships skillfully. How do you deal with a critical colleague? Make your boss listen to you? React to an offensive joke? Get the resources you need? The authors look at over 50 real-life situations and offer people-smart prescriptions for handling them effectively. They provide coaching tips for each scenario and describe exactly what a people-smart response sounds like. As two psychologists with both organizational and clinical expertise, coauthors Mel Silberman and Freda Hansburg are highly qualified to deliver the message that we can emerge from even the toughest interpersonal moments on the job with dignity and grace. Where other books rely on typologies that categorize people according to their interpersonal styles and then offer advice on how to deal with each type, the strategies described in Working PeopleSmart are straightforward and universal. They can be used immediately to deal with any type of person or any situation, no matter how difficult or sensitive.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e", "custom_clean": 1, "custom_lists": [], "custom_lists_ids": null, "custom_read_date": null, "custom_reading_list": 0, "custom_types": [{"id": 1, "sort": "eBook", "value": "eBook"}], "custom_types_ids": "1", "flags": 1, "has_cover": 1, "id": 34, "identifier_ids": "122,121,123", "identifiers": [{"book": 34, "id": 123, "name": "ISBN", "path": "https://www.worldcat.org/isbn/9781576752081", "sort": "isbn", "type": "isbn", "val": "9781576752081"}, {"book": 34, "id": 121, "name": "Google Books", "path": "https://books.google.com/books?id=YZgNngEACAAJ", "sort": "google", "type": "google", "val": "YZgNngEACAAJ"}, {"book": 34, "id": 122, "name": "Goodreads", "path": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1946690", "sort": "goodreads", "type": "goodreads", "val": "1946690"}], "isbn": "9781576752081", "language_ids": "1", "languages": [{"avg_rating": 8.3717277486911, "count": 276, "id": 1, "name": "ENG", "sort": "ENG"}], "last_modified": "2022-10-06 17:19:38.709950+00:00", "order_by": "2022-10-04 13:46:41.441000+00:00", "path": "Melvin L.

Instead, we will let the neural network learn these things for us. Each layer of the neural network learns a different abstraction than the previous layers. For example, in image classification, the first layer might learn different strokes, and in the next layer put the strokes together to learn shapes, and in the next layer put the shapes together to form facial features, and in the next layer have a high level representation of faces.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn top of all this, deep learning is known for winning its fair share Kaggle contests.

Instead, we will let the neural network learn these things for us. Each layer of the neural network learns a different abstraction than the previous layers. For example, in image classification, the first layer might learn different strokes, and in the next layer put the strokes together to learn shapes, and in the next layer put the shapes together to form facial features, and in the next layer have a high level representation of faces.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn top of all this, deep learning is known for winning its fair share Kaggle contests.

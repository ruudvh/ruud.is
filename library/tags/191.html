Coding with Kotlin means less hassle. The Kotlin programming language offers an expressive syntax, a strong intuitive type system, and great tooling support along with seamless interoperability with existing Java code, libraries, and frameworks. Kotlin can be compiled to Java bytecode, so you can use it everywhere Java is used, including Android. And with an effi cient compiler and a small standard library, Kotlin imposes virtually no runtime overhead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAbout the Book\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKotlin in Action teaches you to use the Kotlin language for production-quality applications.

These important advances for security and privacy create new content moderation challenges for online services, because services can no longer directly access plaintext content. While ongoing public policy debates about E2EE and content moderation in the United States and European Union emphasize child sexual abuse material and misinformation in messaging and storage, we identify and synthesize a wealth of scholarship that goes far beyond those topics. We bridge literature that is diverse in both content moderation subject matter, such as malware, spam, hate speech, terrorist content, and enterprise policy compliance, as well as intended deployments, including not only privacy-preserving content moderation for messaging, email, and cloud storage, but also private introspection of encrypted web traffic by middleboxes. In this work, we systematize the study of content moderation in E2EE settings. We set out a process pipeline for content moderation, drawing on a broad interdisciplinary literature that is not specific to E2EE. We examine cryptography and policy design choices at all stages of this pipeline, and we suggest areas of future research to fill gaps in literature and better understand possible paths forward.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e", "custom_clean": 1, "custom_lists": [], "custom_lists_ids": null, "custom_read_date": null, "custom_reading_list": 1, "custom_types": "Paper", "flags": 1, "has_cover": 1, "id": 340, "identifier_ids": "1113", "identifiers": [{"book": 340, "id": 1113, "name": "arXiv", "path": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.03979", "sort": "arxiv", "type": "arxiv", "val": "2303.03979"}], "isbn": null, "language_ids": "1", "languages": [{"avg_rating": 8.429245283018869, "count": 341, "id": 1, "name": "ENG", "sort": "ENG"}], "last_modified": "2023-07-16 18:56:10.618541+00:00", "order_by": "2023-05-23 12:48:00.634174+00:00", "path": "Sarah Scheffler/SoK_ Content Moderation for End-to- (340)", "pubdate": "2023-03-08", "publisher_ids": "125", "publishers": [{"avg_rating": null, "count": 9, "id": 125, "name": "arXiv", "sort": "arXiv"}], "rating": null, "series": [], "series_ids": null, "size": 1598984, "tag_ids": "191,350,351,352", "tags": [{"avg_rating": 7.857142857142857, "count": 28, "id": 191, "name": "Computer Science", "sort": 28}, {"avg_rating": null, "count": 1, "id": 350, "name": "End-to-End Encryption", "sort": 1}, {"avg_rating": null, "count": 1, "id": 351, "name": "Content Moderation", "sort": 1}, {"avg_rating": null, "count": 1, "id": 352, "name": "Privacy", "sort": 1}], "timestamp": "2023-05-23 12:48:00.634174+00:00", "title": "SoK: Content Moderation for End-to-End Encryption"}, {"author_ids": "379,380", "authors": [{"avg_rating": 8.0, "count": 1, "id": 380, "name": "Sophie Debenedetto", "sort": "Debenedetto, Sophie"}, {"avg_rating": 8.0, "count": 1, "id": 379, "name": "Bruce A.

When it comes to improbable innovations, a legendary tech VC told Sebastian Mallaby, the future cannot be predicted, it can only be discovered. It is the nature of the venture-capital game that most attempts at discovery fail, but a very few succeed at such a scale that they more than make up for everything else. That extreme ratio of success and failure is the power law that drives the VC business, all of Silicon Valley, the wider tech sector, and, by extension, the world.\u00a0\u00a0 In The Power Law, Sebastian Mallaby has parlayed unprecedented access to the most celebrated venture capitalists of all time\u2014the key figures at Sequoia, Kleiner Perkins, Accel, Benchmark, and Andreessen Horowitz, as well as Chinese partnerships such as Qiming and Capital Today\u2014into a riveting blend of storytelling and analysis that unfurls the history of tech incubation, in the Valley and ultimately worldwide. We learn the unvarnished truth, often for the first time, about some of the most iconic triumphs and infamous disasters in Valley history, from the comedy of errors at the birth of Apple to the avalanche of venture money that fostered hubris at WeWork and Uber.\u00a0 VCs\u2019 relentless search for grand slams brews an obsession with the ideal of the lone entrepreneur-genius, and companies seen as potential \u201cunicorns\u201d are given intoxicating amounts of power, with sometimes disastrous results. On a more systemic level, the need to make outsized bets on unproven talent reinforces bias, with women and minorities still represented at woefully low levels. This does not just have social justice implications: as Mallaby relates, China\u2019s homegrown VC sector, having learned at the Valley\u2019s feet, is exploding and now has more women VC luminaries than America has ever had. Still, Silicon Valley VC remains the top incubator of business innovation anywhere\u2014it is not where ideas come from so much as where they go to become the products and companies that create the future. By taking us so deeply into the VCs\u2019 game, The Power Law helps us think about our own future through their eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e", "custom_clean": 1, "custom_lists": [], "custom_lists_ids": null, "custom_read_date": null, "custom_reading_list": 1, "custom_types": "eBook", "flags": 1, "has_cover": 1, "id": 257, "identifier_ids": "879,880", "identifiers": [{"book": 257, "id": 880, "name": "ISBN", "path": "https://www.worldcat.org/isbn/9780525560005", "sort": "isbn", "type": "isbn", "val": "9780525560005"}, {"book": 257, "id": 879, "name": "Google Books", "path": "https://books.google.com/books?id=a3YsEAAAQBAJ", "sort": "google", "type": "google", "val": "a3YsEAAAQBAJ"}], "isbn": "9780525560005", "language_ids": "1", "languages": [{"avg_rating": 8.429245283018869, "count": 341, "id": 1, "name": "ENG", "sort": "ENG"}], "last_modified": "2023-07-21 14:34:52.350604+00:00", "order_by": "2023-01-27 19:15:58.396903+00:00", "path": "Sebastian Mallaby/The Power Law_ Venture Capital and (257)", "pubdate": "2022-02-01", "publisher_ids": "90", "publishers": [{"avg_rating": 8.8, "count": 20, "id": 90, "name": "Penguin Random House", "sort": "Penguin Random House"}], "rating": null, "series": [], "series_ids": null, "size": 12214615, "tag_ids": "11,191,245,246", "tags": [{"avg_rating": 7.857142857142857, "count": 28, "id": 191, "name": "Computer Science", "sort": 28}, {"avg_rating": 8.2, "count": 13, "id": 11, "name": "Business \u0026 Economics", "sort": 13}, {"avg_rating": 10.0, "count": 2, "id": 245, "name": "Corporate Finance", "sort": 2}, {"avg_rating": 10.0, "count": 2, "id": 246, "name": "Venture Capital", "sort": 2}], "timestamp": "2023-01-27 19:15:58.396903+00:00", "title": "The Power Law: Venture Capital and the Making of the New Future"}, {"author_ids": "325,326,327,328,329,330,331", "authors": [{"avg_rating": null, "count": 1, "id": 329, "name": "Piotr Bojanowski", "sort": "Bojanowski, Piotr"}, {"avg_rating": null, "count": 1, "id": 326, "name": "Mathilde Caron", "sort": "Caron, Mathilde"}, {"avg_rating": null, "count": 1, "id": 331, "name": "Edouard Grave", "sort": "Grave, Edouard"}, {"avg_rating": null, "count": 1, "id": 327, "name": "Lucas Hosseini", "sort": "Hosseini, Lucas"}, {"avg_rating": null, "count": 1, "id": 325, "name": "Gautier Izacard", "sort": "Izacard, Gautier"}, {"avg_rating": null, "count": 1, "id": 330, "name": "Armand Joulin", "sort": "Joulin, Armand"}, {"avg_rating": null, "count": 1, "id": 328, "name": "Sebastian Riedel", "sort": "Riedel, Sebastian"}], "comments": "\u003cdiv\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRecently, information retrieval has seen the emergence of dense retrievers, using neural networks, as an alternative to classical sparse methods based on term-frequency. These models have obtained state-of-the-art results on datasets and tasks where large training sets are available. However, they do not transfer well to new applications with no training data, and are outperformed by unsupervised term-frequency methods such as BM25. In this work, we explore the limits of contrastive learning as a way to train unsupervised dense retrievers and show that it leads to strong performance in various retrieval settings. On the BEIR benchmark our unsupervised model outperforms BM25 on 11 out of 15 datasets for the Recall@100. When used as pre-training before fine-tuning, either on a few thousands in-domain examples or on the large MS~MARCO dataset, our contrastive model leads to improvements on the BEIR benchmark. Finally, we evaluate our approach for multi-lingual retrieval, where training data is even scarcer than for English, and show that our approach leads to strong unsupervised performance. Our model also exhibits strong cross-lingual transfer when fine-tuned on supervised English data only and evaluated on low resources language such as Swahili. We show that our unsupervised models can perform cross-lingual retrieval between different scripts, such as retrieving English documents from Arabic queries, which would not be possible with term matching methods.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e", "custom_clean": 1, "custom_lists": [{"id": 3, "sort": "Machine Learning.Deep Learning", "value": "Machine Learning.Deep Learning"}], "custom_lists_ids": "3", "custom_read_date": null, "custom_reading_list": 1, "custom_types": "Paper", "flags": 1, "has_cover": 1, "id": 247, "identifier_ids": "927", "identifiers": [{"book": 247, "id": 927, "name": "arXiv", "path": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.09118", "sort": "arxiv", "type": "arxiv", "val": "2112.09118"}], "isbn": null, "language_ids": "1", "languages": [{"avg_rating": 8.429245283018869, "count": 341, "id": 1, "name": "ENG", "sort": "ENG"}], "last_modified": "2023-03-16 22:08:36.421370+00:00", "order_by": "2022-12-05 19:21:52.360004+00:00", "path": "Gautier Izacard/Unsupervised Dense Information Retr (247)", "pubdate": "2022-12-05", "publisher_ids": "125", "publishers": [{"avg_rating": null, "count": 9, "id": 125, "name": "arXiv", "sort": "arXiv"}], "rating": null, "series": [], "series_ids": null, "size": 686136, "tag_ids": "186,189,191,237", "tags": [{"avg_rating": 7.857142857142857, "count": 28, "id": 191, "name": "Computer Science", "sort": 28}, {"avg_rating": null, "count": 11, "id": 189, "name": "Deep Learning", "sort": 11}, {"avg_rating": null, "count": 10, "id": 186, "name": "Machine Learning", "sort": 10}, {"avg_rating": null, "count": 1, "id": 237, "name": "Information Retrieval", "sort": 1}], "timestamp": "2022-12-05 19:21:52.360004+00:00", "title": "Unsupervised Dense Information Retrieval with Contrastive Learning"}, {"author_ids": "301,320,321,322,323", "authors": [{"avg_rating": null, "count": 1, "id": 320, "name": "Eric Breck", "sort": "Breck, Eric"}, {"avg_rating": null, "count": 1, "id": 321, "name": "Shanqing Cai", "sort": "Cai, Shanqing"}, {"avg_rating": null, "count": 1, "id": 322, "name": "Eric Nielsen", "sort": "Nielsen, Eric"}, {"avg_rating": null, "count": 1, "id": 323, "name": "Michael Salib", "sort": "Salib, Michael"}, {"avg_rating": null, "count": 2, "id": 301, "name": "D.

Testing and monitoring are key considerations for ensuring the production-readiness of an ML system, and for reducing technical debt of ML systems. But it can be difficult to formulate specific tests, given that the actual prediction behavior of any given model is difficult to specify a priori. In this paper, we present 28 specific tests and monitoring needs, drawn from experience with a wide range of production ML systems to help quantify these issues and present an easy to follow road-map to improve production readiness and pay down ML technical debt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAvailable at: https://research.google/pubs/pub46555/\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e", "custom_clean": 1, "custom_lists": [{"id": 3, "sort": "Machine Learning.Deep Learning", "value": "Machine Learning.Deep Learning"}], "custom_lists_ids": "3", "custom_read_date": "2022-10-27", "custom_reading_list": 0, "custom_types": "Paper", "flags": 1, "has_cover": 1, "id": 246, "identifier_ids": null, "identifiers": [], "isbn": null, "language_ids": "1", "languages": [{"avg_rating": 8.429245283018869, "count": 341, "id": 1, "name": "ENG", "sort": "ENG"}], "last_modified": "2023-07-21 18:01:20.087752+00:00", "order_by": "2022-10-27 09:23:10.337237+00:00", "path": "Eric Breck/A Rubric for ML Production Readines (246)", "pubdate": "2017-01-05", "publisher_ids": "146", "publishers": [{"avg_rating": null, "count": 2, "id": 146, "name": "IEEE", "sort": "IEEE"}], "rating": null, "series": [], "series_ids": null, "size": 500055, "tag_ids": "186,189,191", "tags": [{"avg_rating": 7.857142857142857, "count": 28, "id": 191, "name": "Computer Science", "sort": 28}, {"avg_rating": null, "count": 11, "id": 189, "name": "Deep Learning", "sort": 11}, {"avg_rating": null, "count": 10, "id": 186, "name": "Machine Learning", "sort": 10}], "timestamp": "2022-10-27 09:23:10.337237+00:00", "title": "A Rubric for ML Production Readiness and Technical Debt Reduction"}, {"author_ids": "314,315,316,317,318,319", "authors": [{"avg_rating": null, "count": 1, "id": 314, "name": "Saleema Amershi", "sort": "Amershi, Saleema"}, {"avg_rating": null, "count": 1, "id": 315, "name": "Andrew Begel", "sort": "Begel, Andrew"}, {"avg_rating": null, "count": 1, "id": 316, "name": "Christian Bird", "sort": "Bird, Christian"}, {"avg_rating": null, "count": 1, "id": 317, "name": "Robert DeLine", "sort": "DeLine, Robert"}, {"avg_rating": null, "count": 1, "id": 318, "name": "Harald Gall", "sort": "Gall, Harald"}, {"avg_rating": null, "count": 1, "id": 319, "name": "Ece Kamar", "sort": "Kamar, Ece"}], "comments": "\u003cdiv\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRecent advances in machine learning have stimulated widespread interest within the Information Technology sector on integrating AI capabilities into software and services. This goal has forced organizations to evolve their development processes. We report on a study that we conducted on observing software teams at Microsoft as they develop AI-based applications. We consider a nine-stage workflow process informed by prior experiences developing AI applications (e.g., search and NLP) and data science tools (e.g. application diagnostics and bug reporting). We found that various Microsoft teams have united this workflow into preexisting, well-evolved, Agile-like software engineering processes, providing insights about several essential engineering challenges that organizations may face in creating large-scale AI solutions for the marketplace. We collected some best practices from Microsoft teams to address these challenges. In addition, we have identified three aspects of the AI domain that make it fundamentally different from prior software application domains: 1) discovering, managing, and versioning the data needed for machine learning applications is much more complex and difficult than other types of software engineering, 2) model customization and model reuse require very different skills than are typically found in software teams, and 3) AI components are more difficult to handle as distinct modules than traditional software components - models may be \"entangled\" in complex ways and experience non-monotonic error behavior. We believe that the lessons learned by Microsoft teams will be valuable to other organizations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAvailable at: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8804457\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e", "custom_clean": 1, "custom_lists": [{"id": 3, "sort": "Machine Learning.Deep Learning", "value": "Machine Learning.Deep Learning"}], "custom_lists_ids": "3", "custom_read_date": "2022-10-27", "custom_reading_list": 0, "custom_types": "Paper", "flags": 1, "has_cover": 1, "id": 245, "identifier_ids": null, "identifiers": [], "isbn": null, "language_ids": "1", "languages": [{"avg_rating": 8.429245283018869, "count": 341, "id": 1, "name": "ENG", "sort": "ENG"}], "last_modified": "2023-07-21 18:00:59.482189+00:00", "order_by": "2022-10-27 09:23:10.143958+00:00", "path": "Saleema Amershi/Software Engineering for Machine Le (245)", "pubdate": "2019-01-01", "publisher_ids": "146", "publishers": [{"avg_rating": null, "count": 2, "id": 146, "name": "IEEE", "sort": "IEEE"}], "rating": null, "series": [], "series_ids": null, "size": 203640, "tag_ids": "186,189,191,226", "tags": [{"avg_rating": 7.857142857142857, "count": 28, "id": 191, "name": "Computer Science", "sort": 28}, {"avg_rating": null, "count": 11, "id": 189, "name": "Deep Learning", "sort": 11}, {"avg_rating": null, "count": 10, "id": 186, "name": "Machine Learning", "sort": 10}, {"avg_rating": 8.0, "count": 2, "id": 226, "name": "Software Design \u0026 Engineering", "sort": 2}], "timestamp": "2022-10-27 09:23:10.143958+00:00", "title": "Software Engineering for Machine Learning: A Case Study"}, {"author_ids": "301,302,303,304,305,306,307,308,309,310", "authors": [{"avg_rating": null, "count": 1, "id": 307, "name": "Vinay Chaudhary", "sort": "Chaudhary, Vinay"}, {"avg_rating": null, "count": 1, "id": 309, "name": "Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Crespo", "sort": "Crespo, Jean-Fran\u00e7ois"}, {"avg_rating": null, "count": 1, "id": 304, "name": "Eugene Davydov", "sort": "Davydov, Eugene"}, {"avg_rating": null, "count": 1, "id": 310, "name": "Dan Dennison", "sort": "Dennison, Dan"}, {"avg_rating": null, "count": 1, "id": 306, "name": "Dietmar Ebner", "sort": "Ebner, Dietmar"}, {"avg_rating": null, "count": 1, "id": 303, "name": "Daniel Golovin", "sort": "Golovin, Daniel"}, {"avg_rating": null, "count": 1, "id": 302, "name": "Gary Holt", "sort": "Holt, Gary"}, {"avg_rating": null, "count": 1, "id": 305, "name": "Todd Phillips", "sort": "Phillips, Todd"}, {"avg_rating": null, "count": 2, "id": 301, "name": "D.

Our intuition is simple: learn what the world looks like and how it is described from paired text-image data, and learn how the world moves from unsupervised video footage. Make-A-Video has three advantages: (1) it accelerates training of the T2V model (it does not need to learn visual and multimodal representations from scratch), (2) it does not require paired text-video data, and (3) the generated videos inherit the vastness (diversity in aesthetic, fantastical depictions, etc.) of today\u0027s image generation models. We design a simple yet effective way to build on T2I models with novel and effective spatial-temporal modules. First, we decompose the full temporal U-Net and attention tensors and approximate them in space and time. Second, we design a spatial temporal pipeline to generate high resolution and frame rate videos with a video decoder, interpolation model and two super resolution models that can enable various applications besides T2V. In all aspects, spatial and temporal resolution, faithfulness to text, and quality, Make-A-Video sets the new state-of-the-art in text-to-video generation, as determined by both qualitative and quantitative measures.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e", "custom_clean": 1, "custom_lists": [{"id": 3, "sort": "Machine Learning.Deep Learning", "value": "Machine Learning.Deep Learning"}], "custom_lists_ids": "3", "custom_read_date": "2022-10-06", "custom_reading_list": 0, "custom_types": "Paper", "flags": 1, "has_cover": 1, "id": 202, "identifier_ids": "726", "identifiers": [{"book": 202, "id": 726, "name": "arXiv", "path": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.14792", "sort": "arxiv", "type": "arxiv", "val": "2209.14792"}], "isbn": null, "language_ids": "1", "languages": [{"avg_rating": 8.429245283018869, "count": 341, "id": 1, "name": "ENG", "sort": "ENG"}], "last_modified": "2023-01-27 19:20:40.603931+00:00", "order_by": "2022-10-15 12:36:28+00:00", "path": "Uriel Singer/Make-A-Video_ Text-to-Video Generat (202)", "pubdate": "2022-09-29", "publisher_ids": "125", "publishers": [{"avg_rating": null, "count": 9, "id": 125, "name": "arXiv", "sort": "arXiv"}], "rating": null, "series": [], "series_ids": null, "size": 14464869, "tag_ids": "186,189,191,192", "tags": [{"avg_rating": 7.857142857142857, "count": 28, "id": 191, "name": "Computer Science", "sort": 28}, {"avg_rating": null, "count": 11, "id": 189, "name": "Deep Learning", "sort": 11}, {"avg_rating": null, "count": 10, "id": 186, "name": "Machine Learning", "sort": 10}, {"avg_rating": null, "count": 2, "id": 192, "name": "Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition", "sort": 2}], "timestamp": "2022-10-15 12:36:28+00:00", "title": "Make-A-Video: Text-to-Video Generation without Text-Video Data"}, {"author_ids": "292,293,294,295,296,297,298,299", "authors": [{"avg_rating": null, "count": 1, "id": 297, "name": "Aidan N.

We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer, based solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely. Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.8 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature.

In order to clarify the intended use cases of machine learning models and minimize their usage in contexts for which they are not well suited, we recommend that released models be accompanied by documentation detailing their performance characteristics. In this paper, we propose a framework that we call model cards, to encourage such transparent model reporting. Model cards are short documents accompanying trained machine learning models that provide benchmarked evaluation in a variety of conditions, such as across different cultural, demographic, or phenotypic groups (e.g., race, geographic location, sex, Fitzpatrick skin type) and intersectional groups (e.g., age and race, or sex and Fitzpatrick skin type) that are relevant to the intended application domains. Model cards also disclose the context in which models are intended to be used, details of the performance evaluation procedures, and other relevant information. While we focus primarily on human-centered machine learning models in the application fields of computer vision and natural language processing, this framework can be used to document any trained machine learning model. To solidify the concept, we provide cards for two supervised models: One trained to detect smiling faces in images, and one trained to detect toxic comments in text. We propose model cards as a step towards the responsible democratization of machine learning and related AI technology, increasing transparency into how well AI technology works. We hope this work encourages those releasing trained machine learning models to accompany model releases with similar detailed evaluation numbers and other relevant documentation.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e", "custom_clean": 1, "custom_lists": [{"id": 3, "sort": "Machine Learning.Deep Learning", "value": "Machine Learning.Deep Learning"}], "custom_lists_ids": "3", "custom_read_date": null, "custom_reading_list": 1, "custom_types": "Paper", "flags": 1, "has_cover": 1, "id": 239, "identifier_ids": "835", "identifiers": [{"book": 239, "id": 835, "name": "arXiv", "path": "https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.03993", "sort": "arxiv", "type": "arxiv", "val": "1810.03993"}], "isbn": null, "language_ids": "1", "languages": [{"avg_rating": 8.429245283018869, "count": 341, "id": 1, "name": "ENG", "sort": "ENG"}], "last_modified": "2023-01-27 19:20:40.603931+00:00", "order_by": "2022-10-12 20:13:38.586617+00:00", "path": "Margaret Mitchell/Model Cards for Model Reporting (239)", "pubdate": "2018-10-05", "publisher_ids": "125", "publishers": [{"avg_rating": null, "count": 9, "id": 125, "name": "arXiv", "sort": "arXiv"}], "rating": null, "series": [], "series_ids": null, "size": 995470, "tag_ids": "186,189,191", "tags": [{"avg_rating": 7.857142857142857, "count": 28, "id": 191, "name": "Computer Science", "sort": 28}, {"avg_rating": null, "count": 11, "id": 189, "name": "Deep Learning", "sort": 11}, {"avg_rating": null, "count": 10, "id": 186, "name": "Machine Learning", "sort": 10}], "timestamp": "2022-10-12 20:13:38.586617+00:00", "title": "Model Cards for Model Reporting"}, {"author_ids": "220,222,287,288,289,290", "authors": [{"avg_rating": null, "count": 1, "id": 289, "name": "Greg Brockman", "sort": "Brockman, Greg"}, {"avg_rating": null, "count": 2, "id": 220, "name": "Jong Wook Kim", "sort": "Kim, Jong Wook"}, {"avg_rating": null, "count": 1, "id": 290, "name": "Christine McLeavey", "sort": "McLeavey, Christine"}, {"avg_rating": null, "count": 1, "id": 287, "name": "Alex Radford", "sort": "Radford, Alex"}, {"avg_rating": null, "count": 2, "id": 222, "name": "Ilya Sutskever", "sort": "Sutskever, Ilya"}, {"avg_rating": null, "count": 1, "id": 288, "name": "Tao Xu", "sort": "Xu, Tao"}], "comments": "\u003cdiv\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe study the capabilities of speech processing systems trained simply to predict large amounts of transcripts of audio on the internet.

However, these models lack the ability to mimic the appearance of subjects in a given reference set and synthesize novel renditions of them in different contexts. In this work, we present a new approach for \"personalization\" of text-to-image diffusion models (specializing them to users\u0027 needs). Given as input just a few images of a subject, we fine-tune a pretrained text-to-image model (Imagen, although our method is not limited to a specific model) such that it learns to bind a unique identifier with that specific subject. Once the subject is embedded in the output domain of the model, the unique identifier can then be used to synthesize fully-novel photorealistic images of the subject contextualized in different scenes. By leveraging the semantic prior embedded in the model with a new autogenous class-specific prior preservation loss, our technique enables synthesizing the subject in diverse scenes, poses, views, and lighting conditions that do not appear in the reference images. We apply our technique to several previously-unassailable tasks, including subject recontextualization, text-guided view synthesis, appearance modification, and artistic rendering (all while preserving the subject\u0027s key features).\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e", "custom_clean": 1, "custom_lists": [{"id": 3, "sort": "Machine Learning.Deep Learning", "value": "Machine Learning.Deep Learning"}], "custom_lists_ids": "3", "custom_read_date": "2022-08-17", "custom_reading_list": 0, "custom_types": "Paper", "flags": 1, "has_cover": 1, "id": 201, "identifier_ids": "724", "identifiers": [{"book": 201, "id": 724, "name": "arXiv", "path": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.12242", "sort": "arxiv", "type": "arxiv", "val": "2208.12242"}], "isbn": null, "language_ids": "1", "languages": [{"avg_rating": 8.429245283018869, "count": 341, "id": 1, "name": "ENG", "sort": "ENG"}], "last_modified": "2022-10-19 08:42:27.829507+00:00", "order_by": "2022-10-10 10:33:15+00:00", "path": "Nataniel Ruiz/DreamBooth Fine Tuning T2I Diffusio (201)", "pubdate": "2022-08-25", "publisher_ids": "125", "publishers": [{"avg_rating": null, "count": 9, "id": 125, "name": "arXiv", "sort": "arXiv"}], "rating": null, "series": [], "series_ids": null, "size": 17258364, "tag_ids": "188,189,191,192", "tags": [{"avg_rating": 7.857142857142857, "count": 28, "id": 191, "name": "Computer Science", "sort": 28}, {"avg_rating": null, "count": 11, "id": 189, "name": "Deep Learning", "sort": 11}, {"avg_rating": null, "count": 2, "id": 188, "name": "Paper", "sort": 2}, {"avg_rating": null, "count": 2, "id": 192, "name": "Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition", "sort": 2}], "timestamp": "2022-10-10 10:33:15+00:00", "title": "DreamBooth Fine Tuning T2I Diffusion Models for Subject Driven Generation"}, {"author_ids": "270", "authors": [{"avg_rating": 10.0, "count": 1, "id": 270, "name": "Allen B.

Learn to build standalone small programs to run as scripts, create type safe code, and then carry that knowledge forward to create fully object-oriented and functional style code that\u0027s easier to extend. Learn how to program with elegance but without compromising efficiency or performance, and how to use metaprogramming to build highly expressive code and create internal DSLs that exploit the fluency of the language. Explore coroutines, program asynchrony, run automated tests, and intermix Kotlin with Java in your enterprise applications.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis book will help you master one of the few languages that you can use for the entire full stack - from the server to mobile devices - to create performant, concise, and easy to maintain applications.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e", "custom_clean": 1, "custom_lists": [{"id": 10, "sort": "Programming.Kotlin", "value": "Programming.Kotlin"}], "custom_lists_ids": "10", "custom_read_date": null, "custom_reading_list": 0, "custom_types": "eBook", "flags": 1, "has_cover": 1, "id": 352, "identifier_ids": "1130,1132,1131", "identifiers": [{"book": 352, "id": 1131, "name": "ISBN", "path": "https://www.worldcat.org/isbn/9781680506358", "sort": "isbn", "type": "isbn", "val": "9781680506358"}, {"book": 352, "id": 1132, "name": "Google Books", "path": "https://books.google.com/books?id=cIF-vQEACAAJ", "sort": "google", "type": "google", "val": "cIF-vQEACAAJ"}, {"book": 352, "id": 1130, "name": "Amazon", "path": "https://amazon.com/dp/1680506358", "sort": "amazon", "type": "amazon", "val": "1680506358"}], "isbn": "9781680506358", "language_ids": "1", "languages": [{"avg_rating": 8.429245283018869, "count": 341, "id": 1, "name": "ENG", "sort": "ENG"}], "last_modified": "2023-05-26 21:42:07.105429+00:00", "order_by": "2023-05-25 10:15:35.971282+00:00", "path": "Venkat Subramaniam/Programming Kotlin_ Create Elegant, (352)", "pubdate": "2019-05-15", "publisher_ids": "8", "publishers": [{"avg_rating": 8.5, "count": 5, "id": 8, "name": "Pragmatic Bookshelf", "sort": "Pragmatic Bookshelf"}], "rating": 4, "series": [], "series_ids": null, "size": 9375437, "tag_ids": "190,191,339,342,360,361,364,366,367", "tags": [{"avg_rating": 7.714285714285714, "count": 30, "id": 190, "name": "Programming", "sort": 30}, {"avg_rating": 7.857142857142857, "count": 28, "id": 191, "name": "Computer Science", "sort": 28}, {"avg_rating": 7.538461538461538, "count": 18, "id": 339, "name": "Computers", "sort": 18}, {"avg_rating": 7.777777777777778, "count": 11, "id": 364, "name": "Kotlin", "sort": 11}, {"avg_rating": 8.571428571428571, "count": 9, "id": 366, "name": "Java", "sort": 9}, {"avg_rating": 7.428571428571429, "count": 8, "id": 361, "name": "Android", "sort": 8}, {"avg_rating": 7.428571428571429, "count": 7, "id": 360, "name": "Operating Systems", "sort": 7}, {"avg_rating": 8.0, "count": 5, "id": 342, "name": "Web Programming", "sort": 5}, {"avg_rating": 8.0, "count": 2, "id": 367, "name": "Web", "sort": 2}], "timestamp": "2023-05-25 10:15:35.971282+00:00", "title": "Programming Kotlin: Create Elegant, Expressive, and Performant Jvm and Android Applications"}, {"author_ids": "403", "authors": [{"avg_rating": null, "count": 1, "id": 403, "name": "John Hunt", "sort": "Hunt, John"}], "comments": "\u003cdiv\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis textbook assumes very little knowledge of programming so whether you have dabbled with a little JavaScript, played with a bit of Python, written Java or have virtually no programming experience at all you will find that it is for you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe first part of the book introduces Kotlin program structures as well as conditional flow of control features such as if and when expressions as well as iteration loops such as for, while and do-while.

Coding with Kotlin means less hassle. The Kotlin programming language offers an expressive syntax, a strong intuitive type system, and great tooling support along with seamless interoperability with existing Java code, libraries, and frameworks. Kotlin can be compiled to Java bytecode, so you can use it everywhere Java is used, including Android. And with an effi cient compiler and a small standard library, Kotlin imposes virtually no runtime overhead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAbout the Book\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKotlin in Action teaches you to use the Kotlin language for production-quality applications.

These important advances for security and privacy create new content moderation challenges for online services, because services can no longer directly access plaintext content. While ongoing public policy debates about E2EE and content moderation in the United States and European Union emphasize child sexual abuse material and misinformation in messaging and storage, we identify and synthesize a wealth of scholarship that goes far beyond those topics. We bridge literature that is diverse in both content moderation subject matter, such as malware, spam, hate speech, terrorist content, and enterprise policy compliance, as well as intended deployments, including not only privacy-preserving content moderation for messaging, email, and cloud storage, but also private introspection of encrypted web traffic by middleboxes. In this work, we systematize the study of content moderation in E2EE settings. We set out a process pipeline for content moderation, drawing on a broad interdisciplinary literature that is not specific to E2EE. We examine cryptography and policy design choices at all stages of this pipeline, and we suggest areas of future research to fill gaps in literature and better understand possible paths forward.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e", "custom_clean": 1, "custom_lists": [], "custom_lists_ids": null, "custom_read_date": null, "custom_reading_list": 1, "custom_types": "Paper", "flags": 1, "has_cover": 1, "id": 340, "identifier_ids": "1113", "identifiers": [{"book": 340, "id": 1113, "name": "arXiv", "path": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.03979", "sort": "arxiv", "type": "arxiv", "val": "2303.03979"}], "isbn": null, "language_ids": "1", "languages": [{"avg_rating": 8.429245283018869, "count": 341, "id": 1, "name": "ENG", "sort": "ENG"}], "last_modified": "2023-07-16 18:56:10.618541+00:00", "order_by": "2023-05-23 12:48:00.634174+00:00", "path": "Sarah Scheffler/SoK_ Content Moderation for End-to- (340)", "pubdate": "2023-03-08", "publisher_ids": "125", "publishers": [{"avg_rating": null, "count": 9, "id": 125, "name": "arXiv", "sort": "arXiv"}], "rating": null, "series": [], "series_ids": null, "size": 1598984, "tag_ids": "191,350,351,352", "tags": [{"avg_rating": 7.857142857142857, "count": 28, "id": 191, "name": "Computer Science", "sort": 28}, {"avg_rating": null, "count": 1, "id": 350, "name": "End-to-End Encryption", "sort": 1}, {"avg_rating": null, "count": 1, "id": 351, "name": "Content Moderation", "sort": 1}, {"avg_rating": null, "count": 1, "id": 352, "name": "Privacy", "sort": 1}], "timestamp": "2023-05-23 12:48:00.634174+00:00", "title": "SoK: Content Moderation for End-to-End Encryption"}, {"author_ids": "379,380", "authors": [{"avg_rating": 8.0, "count": 1, "id": 380, "name": "Sophie Debenedetto", "sort": "Debenedetto, Sophie"}, {"avg_rating": 8.0, "count": 1, "id": 379, "name": "Bruce A.

When it comes to improbable innovations, a legendary tech VC told Sebastian Mallaby, the future cannot be predicted, it can only be discovered. It is the nature of the venture-capital game that most attempts at discovery fail, but a very few succeed at such a scale that they more than make up for everything else. That extreme ratio of success and failure is the power law that drives the VC business, all of Silicon Valley, the wider tech sector, and, by extension, the world.\u00a0\u00a0 In The Power Law, Sebastian Mallaby has parlayed unprecedented access to the most celebrated venture capitalists of all time\u2014the key figures at Sequoia, Kleiner Perkins, Accel, Benchmark, and Andreessen Horowitz, as well as Chinese partnerships such as Qiming and Capital Today\u2014into a riveting blend of storytelling and analysis that unfurls the history of tech incubation, in the Valley and ultimately worldwide. We learn the unvarnished truth, often for the first time, about some of the most iconic triumphs and infamous disasters in Valley history, from the comedy of errors at the birth of Apple to the avalanche of venture money that fostered hubris at WeWork and Uber.\u00a0 VCs\u2019 relentless search for grand slams brews an obsession with the ideal of the lone entrepreneur-genius, and companies seen as potential \u201cunicorns\u201d are given intoxicating amounts of power, with sometimes disastrous results. On a more systemic level, the need to make outsized bets on unproven talent reinforces bias, with women and minorities still represented at woefully low levels. This does not just have social justice implications: as Mallaby relates, China\u2019s homegrown VC sector, having learned at the Valley\u2019s feet, is exploding and now has more women VC luminaries than America has ever had. Still, Silicon Valley VC remains the top incubator of business innovation anywhere\u2014it is not where ideas come from so much as where they go to become the products and companies that create the future.

These models have obtained state-of-the-art results on datasets and tasks where large training sets are available. However, they do not transfer well to new applications with no training data, and are outperformed by unsupervised term-frequency methods such as BM25. In this work, we explore the limits of contrastive learning as a way to train unsupervised dense retrievers and show that it leads to strong performance in various retrieval settings. On the BEIR benchmark our unsupervised model outperforms BM25 on 11 out of 15 datasets for the Recall@100. When used as pre-training before fine-tuning, either on a few thousands in-domain examples or on the large MS~MARCO dataset, our contrastive model leads to improvements on the BEIR benchmark. Finally, we evaluate our approach for multi-lingual retrieval, where training data is even scarcer than for English, and show that our approach leads to strong unsupervised performance. Our model also exhibits strong cross-lingual transfer when fine-tuned on supervised English data only and evaluated on low resources language such as Swahili. We show that our unsupervised models can perform cross-lingual retrieval between different scripts, such as retrieving English documents from Arabic queries, which would not be possible with term matching methods.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e", "custom_clean": 1, "custom_lists": [{"id": 3, "sort": "Machine Learning.Deep Learning", "value": "Machine Learning.Deep Learning"}], "custom_lists_ids": "3", "custom_read_date": null, "custom_reading_list": 1, "custom_types": "Paper", "flags": 1, "has_cover": 1, "id": 247, "identifier_ids": "927", "identifiers": [{"book": 247, "id": 927, "name": "arXiv", "path": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.09118", "sort": "arxiv", "type": "arxiv", "val": "2112.09118"}], "isbn": null, "language_ids": "1", "languages": [{"avg_rating": 8.429245283018869, "count": 341, "id": 1, "name": "ENG", "sort": "ENG"}], "last_modified": "2023-03-16 22:08:36.421370+00:00", "order_by": "2022-12-05 19:21:52.360004+00:00", "path": "Gautier Izacard/Unsupervised Dense Information Retr (247)", "pubdate": "2022-12-05", "publisher_ids": "125", "publishers": [{"avg_rating": null, "count": 9, "id": 125, "name": "arXiv", "sort": "arXiv"}], "rating": null, "series": [], "series_ids": null, "size": 686136, "tag_ids": "186,189,191,237", "tags": [{"avg_rating": 7.857142857142857, "count": 28, "id": 191, "name": "Computer Science", "sort": 28}, {"avg_rating": null, "count": 11, "id": 189, "name": "Deep Learning", "sort": 11}, {"avg_rating": null, "count": 10, "id": 186, "name": "Machine Learning", "sort": 10}, {"avg_rating": null, "count": 1, "id": 237, "name": "Information Retrieval", "sort": 1}], "timestamp": "2022-12-05 19:21:52.360004+00:00", "title": "Unsupervised Dense Information Retrieval with Contrastive Learning"}, {"author_ids": "301,320,321,322,323", "authors": [{"avg_rating": null, "count": 1, "id": 320, "name": "Eric Breck", "sort": "Breck, Eric"}, {"avg_rating": null, "count": 1, "id": 321, "name": "Shanqing Cai", "sort": "Cai, Shanqing"}, {"avg_rating": null, "count": 1, "id": 322, "name": "Eric Nielsen", "sort": "Nielsen, Eric"}, {"avg_rating": null, "count": 1, "id": 323, "name": "Michael Salib", "sort": "Salib, Michael"}, {"avg_rating": null, "count": 2, "id": 301, "name": "D.

This goal has forced organizations to evolve their development processes. We report on a study that we conducted on observing software teams at Microsoft as they develop AI-based applications. We consider a nine-stage workflow process informed by prior experiences developing AI applications (e.g., search and NLP) and data science tools (e.g. application diagnostics and bug reporting). We found that various Microsoft teams have united this workflow into preexisting, well-evolved, Agile-like software engineering processes, providing insights about several essential engineering challenges that organizations may face in creating large-scale AI solutions for the marketplace. We collected some best practices from Microsoft teams to address these challenges. In addition, we have identified three aspects of the AI domain that make it fundamentally different from prior software application domains: 1) discovering, managing, and versioning the data needed for machine learning applications is much more complex and difficult than other types of software engineering, 2) model customization and model reuse require very different skills than are typically found in software teams, and 3) AI components are more difficult to handle as distinct modules than traditional software components - models may be \"entangled\" in complex ways and experience non-monotonic error behavior.

Our intuition is simple: learn what the world looks like and how it is described from paired text-image data, and learn how the world moves from unsupervised video footage. Make-A-Video has three advantages: (1) it accelerates training of the T2V model (it does not need to learn visual and multimodal representations from scratch), (2) it does not require paired text-video data, and (3) the generated videos inherit the vastness (diversity in aesthetic, fantastical depictions, etc.) of today\u0027s image generation models. We design a simple yet effective way to build on T2I models with novel and effective spatial-temporal modules. First, we decompose the full temporal U-Net and attention tensors and approximate them in space and time. Second, we design a spatial temporal pipeline to generate high resolution and frame rate videos with a video decoder, interpolation model and two super resolution models that can enable various applications besides T2V. In all aspects, spatial and temporal resolution, faithfulness to text, and quality, Make-A-Video sets the new state-of-the-art in text-to-video generation, as determined by both qualitative and quantitative measures.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e", "custom_clean": 1, "custom_lists": [{"id": 3, "sort": "Machine Learning.Deep Learning", "value": "Machine Learning.Deep Learning"}], "custom_lists_ids": "3", "custom_read_date": "2022-10-06", "custom_reading_list": 0, "custom_types": "Paper", "flags": 1, "has_cover": 1, "id": 202, "identifier_ids": "726", "identifiers": [{"book": 202, "id": 726, "name": "arXiv", "path": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.14792", "sort": "arxiv", "type": "arxiv", "val": "2209.14792"}], "isbn": null, "language_ids": "1", "languages": [{"avg_rating": 8.429245283018869, "count": 341, "id": 1, "name": "ENG", "sort": "ENG"}], "last_modified": "2023-01-27 19:20:40.603931+00:00", "order_by": "2022-10-15 12:36:28+00:00", "path": "Uriel Singer/Make-A-Video_ Text-to-Video Generat (202)", "pubdate": "2022-09-29", "publisher_ids": "125", "publishers": [{"avg_rating": null, "count": 9, "id": 125, "name": "arXiv", "sort": "arXiv"}], "rating": null, "series": [], "series_ids": null, "size": 14464869, "tag_ids": "186,189,191,192", "tags": [{"avg_rating": 7.857142857142857, "count": 28, "id": 191, "name": "Computer Science", "sort": 28}, {"avg_rating": null, "count": 11, "id": 189, "name": "Deep Learning", "sort": 11}, {"avg_rating": null, "count": 10, "id": 186, "name": "Machine Learning", "sort": 10}, {"avg_rating": null, "count": 2, "id": 192, "name": "Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition", "sort": 2}], "timestamp": "2022-10-15 12:36:28+00:00", "title": "Make-A-Video: Text-to-Video Generation without Text-Video Data"}, {"author_ids": "292,293,294,295,296,297,298,299", "authors": [{"avg_rating": null, "count": 1, "id": 297, "name": "Aidan N.

We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer, based solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely. Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.8 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature.

In order to clarify the intended use cases of machine learning models and minimize their usage in contexts for which they are not well suited, we recommend that released models be accompanied by documentation detailing their performance characteristics. In this paper, we propose a framework that we call model cards, to encourage such transparent model reporting. Model cards are short documents accompanying trained machine learning models that provide benchmarked evaluation in a variety of conditions, such as across different cultural, demographic, or phenotypic groups (e.g., race, geographic location, sex, Fitzpatrick skin type) and intersectional groups (e.g., age and race, or sex and Fitzpatrick skin type) that are relevant to the intended application domains. Model cards also disclose the context in which models are intended to be used, details of the performance evaluation procedures, and other relevant information. While we focus primarily on human-centered machine learning models in the application fields of computer vision and natural language processing, this framework can be used to document any trained machine learning model. To solidify the concept, we provide cards for two supervised models: One trained to detect smiling faces in images, and one trained to detect toxic comments in text. We propose model cards as a step towards the responsible democratization of machine learning and related AI technology, increasing transparency into how well AI technology works. We hope this work encourages those releasing trained machine learning models to accompany model releases with similar detailed evaluation numbers and other relevant documentation.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e", "custom_clean": 1, "custom_lists": [{"id": 3, "sort": "Machine Learning.Deep Learning", "value": "Machine Learning.Deep Learning"}], "custom_lists_ids": "3", "custom_read_date": null, "custom_reading_list": 1, "custom_types": "Paper", "flags": 1, "has_cover": 1, "id": 239, "identifier_ids": "835", "identifiers": [{"book": 239, "id": 835, "name": "arXiv", "path": "https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.03993", "sort": "arxiv", "type": "arxiv", "val": "1810.03993"}], "isbn": null, "language_ids": "1", "languages": [{"avg_rating": 8.429245283018869, "count": 341, "id": 1, "name": "ENG", "sort": "ENG"}], "last_modified": "2023-01-27 19:20:40.603931+00:00", "order_by": "2022-10-12 20:13:38.586617+00:00", "path": "Margaret Mitchell/Model Cards for Model Reporting (239)", "pubdate": "2018-10-05", "publisher_ids": "125", "publishers": [{"avg_rating": null, "count": 9, "id": 125, "name": "arXiv", "sort": "arXiv"}], "rating": null, "series": [], "series_ids": null, "size": 995470, "tag_ids": "186,189,191", "tags": [{"avg_rating": 7.857142857142857, "count": 28, "id": 191, "name": "Computer Science", "sort": 28}, {"avg_rating": null, "count": 11, "id": 189, "name": "Deep Learning", "sort": 11}, {"avg_rating": null, "count": 10, "id": 186, "name": "Machine Learning", "sort": 10}], "timestamp": "2022-10-12 20:13:38.586617+00:00", "title": "Model Cards for Model Reporting"}, {"author_ids": "220,222,287,288,289,290", "authors": [{"avg_rating": null, "count": 1, "id": 289, "name": "Greg Brockman", "sort": "Brockman, Greg"}, {"avg_rating": null, "count": 2, "id": 220, "name": "Jong Wook Kim", "sort": "Kim, Jong Wook"}, {"avg_rating": null, "count": 1, "id": 290, "name": "Christine McLeavey", "sort": "McLeavey, Christine"}, {"avg_rating": null, "count": 1, "id": 287, "name": "Alex Radford", "sort": "Radford, Alex"}, {"avg_rating": null, "count": 2, "id": 222, "name": "Ilya Sutskever", "sort": "Sutskever, Ilya"}, {"avg_rating": null, "count": 1, "id": 288, "name": "Tao Xu", "sort": "Xu, Tao"}], "comments": "\u003cdiv\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe study the capabilities of speech processing systems trained simply to predict large amounts of transcripts of audio on the internet.

However, these models lack the ability to mimic the appearance of subjects in a given reference set and synthesize novel renditions of them in different contexts. In this work, we present a new approach for \"personalization\" of text-to-image diffusion models (specializing them to users\u0027 needs). Given as input just a few images of a subject, we fine-tune a pretrained text-to-image model (Imagen, although our method is not limited to a specific model) such that it learns to bind a unique identifier with that specific subject. Once the subject is embedded in the output domain of the model, the unique identifier can then be used to synthesize fully-novel photorealistic images of the subject contextualized in different scenes. By leveraging the semantic prior embedded in the model with a new autogenous class-specific prior preservation loss, our technique enables synthesizing the subject in diverse scenes, poses, views, and lighting conditions that do not appear in the reference images. We apply our technique to several previously-unassailable tasks, including subject recontextualization, text-guided view synthesis, appearance modification, and artistic rendering (all while preserving the subject\u0027s key features).\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e", "custom_clean": 1, "custom_lists": [{"id": 3, "sort": "Machine Learning.Deep Learning", "value": "Machine Learning.Deep Learning"}], "custom_lists_ids": "3", "custom_read_date": "2022-08-17", "custom_reading_list": 0, "custom_types": "Paper", "flags": 1, "has_cover": 1, "id": 201, "identifier_ids": "724", "identifiers": [{"book": 201, "id": 724, "name": "arXiv", "path": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.12242", "sort": "arxiv", "type": "arxiv", "val": "2208.12242"}], "isbn": null, "language_ids": "1", "languages": [{"avg_rating": 8.429245283018869, "count": 341, "id": 1, "name": "ENG", "sort": "ENG"}], "last_modified": "2022-10-19 08:42:27.829507+00:00", "order_by": "2022-10-10 10:33:15+00:00", "path": "Nataniel Ruiz/DreamBooth Fine Tuning T2I Diffusio (201)", "pubdate": "2022-08-25", "publisher_ids": "125", "publishers": [{"avg_rating": null, "count": 9, "id": 125, "name": "arXiv", "sort": "arXiv"}], "rating": null, "series": [], "series_ids": null, "size": 17258364, "tag_ids": "188,189,191,192", "tags": [{"avg_rating": 7.857142857142857, "count": 28, "id": 191, "name": "Computer Science", "sort": 28}, {"avg_rating": null, "count": 11, "id": 189, "name": "Deep Learning", "sort": 11}, {"avg_rating": null, "count": 2, "id": 188, "name": "Paper", "sort": 2}, {"avg_rating": null, "count": 2, "id": 192, "name": "Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition", "sort": 2}], "timestamp": "2022-10-10 10:33:15+00:00", "title": "DreamBooth Fine Tuning T2I Diffusion Models for Subject Driven Generation"}, {"author_ids": "270", "authors": [{"avg_rating": 10.0, "count": 1, "id": 270, "name": "Allen B.

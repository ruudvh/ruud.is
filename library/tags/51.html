From the prize-winning and bestselling author of Say Nothing The history of the Sackler dynasty is rife with drama\u2014baroque personal lives; bitter disputes over estates; fistfights in boardrooms; glittering art collections; Machiavellian courtroom maneuvers; and the calculated use of money to burnish reputations and crush the less powerful.\u00a0The Sackler name has adorned the walls of many storied institutions\u2014Harvard, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Oxford, the Louvre. They are one of the richest families in the world, known for their lavish donations to the arts and the sciences. The source of the family fortune was vague, however, until it emerged that the Sacklers were responsible for making and marketing a blockbuster painkiller that was the catalyst for the opioid crisis. Empire of Pain begins with the story of three doctor brothers, Raymond, Mortimer and the incalculably energetic Arthur, who weathered the poverty of the Great Depression and appalling anti-Semitism. Working at a barbaric mental institution, Arthur saw a better way and conducted groundbreaking research into drug treatments. He also had a genius for marketing, especially for pharmaceuticals, and bought a small ad firm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eArthur devised the marketing for Valium, and built the first great Sackler fortune. He purchased a drug manufacturer, Purdue Frederick, which would be run by Raymond and Mortimer. The brothers began collecting art, and wives, and grand residences in exotic locales. Their children and grandchildren grew up in luxury.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eForty years later, Raymond\u2019s son Richard ran the family-owned Purdue. The template Arthur Sackler created to sell Valium\u2014co-opting doctors, influencing the FDA, downplaying the drug\u2019s addictiveness\u2014was employed to launch a far more potent product: OxyContin. The drug went on to generate some thirty-five billion dollars in revenue, and to launch a public health crisis in which hundreds of thousands would die. This is the saga of three generations of a single family and the mark they would leave on the world, a tale that moves from the bustling streets of early twentieth-century Brooklyn to the seaside palaces\u00a0of Greenwich, Connecticut, and Cap d\u2019Antibes to the corridors of power in Washington, D.C.\u00a0 Empire of Pain chronicles the multiple investigations of the Sacklers and their company, and the scorched-earth legal tactics that the family has used to evade accountability.\u00a0Empire of Pain is a masterpiece of narrative reporting and writing, exhaustively documented and ferociously compelling. It is a portrait of the excesses of America\u2019s second Gilded Age, a study of impunity among the super elite and a relentless investigation of the naked greed and indifference to human suffering that built one of the world\u2019s great fortunes.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e", "custom_clean": 1, "custom_lists": [{"id": 5, "sort": "Must Read.2021 Time", "value": "Must Read.2021 Time"}], "custom_lists_ids": "5", "custom_read_date": null, "custom_reading_list": 0, "custom_types": "eBook", "flags": 1, "has_cover": 1, "id": 124, "identifier_ids": "408,406,407", "identifiers": [{"book": 124, "id": 407, "name": "ISBN", "path": "https://www.worldcat.org/isbn/9780385545693", "sort": "isbn", "type": "isbn", "val": "9780385545693"}, {"book": 124, "id": 406, "name": "Google Books", "path": "https://books.google.com/books?id=Qb4IEAAAQBAJ", "sort": "google", "type": "google", "val": "Qb4IEAAAQBAJ"}, {"book": 124, "id": 408, "name": "Goodreads", "path": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43868109", "sort": "goodreads", "type": "goodreads", "val": "43868109"}], "isbn": "9780385545693", "language_ids": "1", "languages": [{"avg_rating": 8.429245283018869, "count": 341, "id": 1, "name": "ENG", "sort": "ENG"}], "last_modified": "2023-05-04 17:55:52.136675+00:00", "order_by": "2022-10-05 15:54:07.602947+00:00", "path": "Patrick Radden Keefe/Empire of Pain_ The Secret History (124)", "pubdate": "2021-04-13", "publisher_ids": "82", "publishers": [{"avg_rating": 8.5, "count": 5, "id": 82, "name": "Knopf Publishing Group", "sort": "Knopf Publishing Group"}], "rating": 5, "series": [], "series_ids": null, "size": 5759595, "tag_ids": "51,57,58,60,92,194", "tags": [{"avg_rating": 8.333333333333334, "count": 40, "id": 194, "name": "Time", "sort": 40}, {"avg_rating": 8.222222222222221, "count": 31, "id": 92, "name": "Biography", "sort": 31}, {"avg_rating": 8.363636363636363, "count": 24, "id": 60, "name": "History", "sort": 24}, {"avg_rating": 8.347826086956522, "count": 23, "id": 57, "name": "Politics", "sort": 23}, {"avg_rating": 8.2, "count": 11, "id": 51, "name": "Business", "sort": 11}, {"avg_rating": 8.222222222222221, "count": 11, "id": 58, "name": "Science", "sort": 11}], "timestamp": "2022-10-05 15:54:07.602947+00:00", "title": "Empire of Pain: The Secret History of the Sackler Dynasty"}, {"author_ids": "4,12", "authors": [{"avg_rating": 7.333333333333333, "count": 3, "id": 4, "name": "Jason Fried", "sort": "Fried, Jason"}, {"avg_rating": 7.333333333333333, "count": 3, "id": 12, "name": "David Heinemeier Hansson", "sort": "Hansson, David Heinemeier"}], "comments": "\u003cdiv\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJason Fried and David Heinemeier Hansson, the authors of the New York Times bestseller Rework, are back with a manifesto to combat all your modern workplace worries and fears. It Doesn\u0027t Have to Be Crazy at Work is a direct successor to Rework, the instant bestseller that showed readers a new path to working effectively. Now Fried and Heinemeier Hansson have returned with a new strategy for the ideal company culture - what they call the calm company . It is a direct attack on the chaos, anxiety and stress that plagues millions of workplaces and billions of people working their day jobs. Working to breaking point with long hours, excessive workload, and a lack of sleep have become a badge of honour for many people these days, when it should be a mark of stupidity. This isn\u0027t just a problem for large organisations; individuals, contractors and solopreneurs are burning themselves out in the very same way. As the authors reveal, the answer isn\u0027t more hours. Rather, it\u0027s less waste and fewer things that induce distraction, always-on anxiety and stress. It is time to stop celebrating crazy and start celebrating calm. Fried and Hansson have the proof to back up their argument. Calm has been the cornerstone of their company\u0027s culture since Basecamp began twenty years ago. Destined to become the management guide for the next generation, It Doesn\u0027t Have to Be Crazy at Work is a practical and inspiring distillation of their insights and experiences. It isn\u0027t a book telling you what to do.

From the prize-winning and bestselling author of Say Nothing The history of the Sackler dynasty is rife with drama\u2014baroque personal lives; bitter disputes over estates; fistfights in boardrooms; glittering art collections; Machiavellian courtroom maneuvers; and the calculated use of money to burnish reputations and crush the less powerful.\u00a0The Sackler name has adorned the walls of many storied institutions\u2014Harvard, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Oxford, the Louvre. They are one of the richest families in the world, known for their lavish donations to the arts and the sciences. The source of the family fortune was vague, however, until it emerged that the Sacklers were responsible for making and marketing a blockbuster painkiller that was the catalyst for the opioid crisis. Empire of Pain begins with the story of three doctor brothers, Raymond, Mortimer and the incalculably energetic Arthur, who weathered the poverty of the Great Depression and appalling anti-Semitism. Working at a barbaric mental institution, Arthur saw a better way and conducted groundbreaking research into drug treatments. He also had a genius for marketing, especially for pharmaceuticals, and bought a small ad firm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eArthur devised the marketing for Valium, and built the first great Sackler fortune. He purchased a drug manufacturer, Purdue Frederick, which would be run by Raymond and Mortimer. The brothers began collecting art, and wives, and grand residences in exotic locales. Their children and grandchildren grew up in luxury.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eForty years later, Raymond\u2019s son Richard ran the family-owned Purdue. The template Arthur Sackler created to sell Valium\u2014co-opting doctors, influencing the FDA, downplaying the drug\u2019s addictiveness\u2014was employed to launch a far more potent product: OxyContin. The drug went on to generate some thirty-five billion dollars in revenue, and to launch a public health crisis in which hundreds of thousands would die. This is the saga of three generations of a single family and the mark they would leave on the world, a tale that moves from the bustling streets of early twentieth-century Brooklyn to the seaside palaces\u00a0of Greenwich, Connecticut, and Cap d\u2019Antibes to the corridors of power in Washington, D.C.\u00a0 Empire of Pain chronicles the multiple investigations of the Sacklers and their company, and the scorched-earth legal tactics that the family has used to evade accountability.\u00a0Empire of Pain is a masterpiece of narrative reporting and writing, exhaustively documented and ferociously compelling. It is a portrait of the excesses of America\u2019s second Gilded Age, a study of impunity among the super elite and a relentless investigation of the naked greed and indifference to human suffering that built one of the world\u2019s great fortunes.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e", "custom_clean": 1, "custom_lists": [{"id": 5, "sort": "Must Read.2021 Time", "value": "Must Read.2021 Time"}], "custom_lists_ids": "5", "custom_read_date": null, "custom_reading_list": 0, "custom_types": "eBook", "flags": 1, "has_cover": 1, "id": 124, "identifier_ids": "408,406,407", "identifiers": [{"book": 124, "id": 407, "name": "ISBN", "path": "https://www.worldcat.org/isbn/9780385545693", "sort": "isbn", "type": "isbn", "val": "9780385545693"}, {"book": 124, "id": 406, "name": "Google Books", "path": "https://books.google.com/books?id=Qb4IEAAAQBAJ", "sort": "google", "type": "google", "val": "Qb4IEAAAQBAJ"}, {"book": 124, "id": 408, "name": "Goodreads", "path": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43868109", "sort": "goodreads", "type": "goodreads", "val": "43868109"}], "isbn": "9780385545693", "language_ids": "1", "languages": [{"avg_rating": 8.429245283018869, "count": 341, "id": 1, "name": "ENG", "sort": "ENG"}], "last_modified": "2023-05-04 17:55:52.136675+00:00", "order_by": "2022-10-05 15:54:07.602947+00:00", "path": "Patrick Radden Keefe/Empire of Pain_ The Secret History (124)", "pubdate": "2021-04-13", "publisher_ids": "82", "publishers": [{"avg_rating": 8.5, "count": 5, "id": 82, "name": "Knopf Publishing Group", "sort": "Knopf Publishing Group"}], "rating": 5, "series": [], "series_ids": null, "size": 5759595, "tag_ids": "51,57,58,60,92,194", "tags": [{"avg_rating": 8.333333333333334, "count": 40, "id": 194, "name": "Time", "sort": 40}, {"avg_rating": 8.222222222222221, "count": 31, "id": 92, "name": "Biography", "sort": 31}, {"avg_rating": 8.363636363636363, "count": 24, "id": 60, "name": "History", "sort": 24}, {"avg_rating": 8.347826086956522, "count": 23, "id": 57, "name": "Politics", "sort": 23}, {"avg_rating": 8.2, "count": 11, "id": 51, "name": "Business", "sort": 11}, {"avg_rating": 8.222222222222221, "count": 11, "id": 58, "name": "Science", "sort": 11}], "timestamp": "2022-10-05 15:54:07.602947+00:00", "title": "Empire of Pain: The Secret History of the Sackler Dynasty"}, {"author_ids": "4,12", "authors": [{"avg_rating": 7.333333333333333, "count": 3, "id": 4, "name": "Jason Fried", "sort": "Fried, Jason"}, {"avg_rating": 7.333333333333333, "count": 3, "id": 12, "name": "David Heinemeier Hansson", "sort": "Hansson, David Heinemeier"}], "comments": "\u003cdiv\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJason Fried and David Heinemeier Hansson, the authors of the New York Times bestseller Rework, are back with a manifesto to combat all your modern workplace worries and fears. It Doesn\u0027t Have to Be Crazy at Work is a direct successor to Rework, the instant bestseller that showed readers a new path to working effectively. Now Fried and Heinemeier Hansson have returned with a new strategy for the ideal company culture - what they call the calm company . It is a direct attack on the chaos, anxiety and stress that plagues millions of workplaces and billions of people working their day jobs. Working to breaking point with long hours, excessive workload, and a lack of sleep have become a badge of honour for many people these days, when it should be a mark of stupidity. This isn\u0027t just a problem for large organisations; individuals, contractors and solopreneurs are burning themselves out in the very same way. As the authors reveal, the answer isn\u0027t more hours. Rather, it\u0027s less waste and fewer things that induce distraction, always-on anxiety and stress. It is time to stop celebrating crazy and start celebrating calm. Fried and Hansson have the proof to back up their argument. Calm has been the cornerstone of their company\u0027s culture since Basecamp began twenty years ago. Destined to become the management guide for the next generation, It Doesn\u0027t Have to Be Crazy at Work is a practical and inspiring distillation of their insights and experiences. It isn\u0027t a book telling you what to do. It\u0027s a book showing you what they\u0027ve done-and how any manager or executive no matter the industry or size of the company, can do it too.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e", "custom_clean": 1, "custom_lists": [], "custom_lists_ids": null, "custom_read_date": null, "custom_reading_list": 0, "custom_types": "eBook", "flags": 1, "has_cover": 1, "id": 57, "identifier_ids": "594,596,592,593,595", "identifiers": [{"book": 57, "id": 595, "name": "ISBN", "path": "https://www.worldcat.org/isbn/9780062874795", "sort": "isbn", "type": "isbn", "val": "9780062874795"}, {"book": 57, "id": 593, "name": "Google Books", "path": "https://books.google.com/books?id=aOlMDwAAQBAJ", "sort": "google", "type": "google", "val": "aOlMDwAAQBAJ"}, {"book": 57, "id": 592, "name": "Goodreads", "path": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39674332", "sort": "goodreads", "type": "goodreads", "val": "39674332"}, {"book": 57, "id": 596, "name": "Barnes \u0026 Noble", "path": "https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/it-doesnt-have-to-be-crazy-at-work-jason-fried/1128018111", "sort": "barnesnoble", "type": "barnesnoble", "val": "w/it-doesnt-have-to-be-crazy-at-work-jason-fried/1128018111"}, {"book": 57, "id": 594, "name": "Amazon", "path": "https://amazon.com/dp/0062874780", "sort": "amazon", "type": "amazon", "val": "0062874780"}], "isbn": "9780062874795", "language_ids": "1", "languages": [{"avg_rating": 8.429245283018869, "count": 341, "id": 1, "name": "ENG", "sort": "ENG"}], "last_modified": "2022-10-06 17:19:38.709950+00:00", "order_by": "2022-10-04 13:46:52.016000+00:00", "path": "Jason Fried/It Doesn\u0027t Have to Be Crazy at Work (57)", "pubdate": "2018-10-02", "publisher_ids": "32", "publishers": [{"avg_rating": 9.0, "count": 29, "id": 32, "name": "HarperCollins", "sort": "HarperCollins"}], "rating": 4, "series": [], "series_ids": null, "size": 2765822, "tag_ids": "43,51", "tags": [{"avg_rating": 8.0, "count": 27, "id": 43, "name": "Self Help", "sort": 27}, {"avg_rating": 8.2, "count": 11, "id": 51, "name": "Business", "sort": 11}], "timestamp": "2022-10-04 13:46:52.016000+00:00", "title": "It Doesn\u0027t Have to Be Crazy at Work"}, {"author_ids": "72", "authors": [{"avg_rating": 8.0, "count": 1, "id": 72, "name": "Leo Babauta", "sort": "Babauta, Leo"}], "comments": "\u003cdiv\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe author writes, \"At the heart of this simple book lies the key to many of the struggles we face these days, from being productive and achieving our goals, to getting healthy and fit in the face of fast food and inactivity, to finding simplicity and peace amidst chaos and confusion.

Among them: a successful, first generation Chinese immigrant musician suffering sexual dysfunction; a young woman whose father abandoned her at age nine with her younger siblings in an isolated cottage in the depth of winter; and a glamorous workaholic whose narcissistic, negligent mother greeted her each morning of her childhood with \"Good morning, Monster.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEach patient presents a mystery, one that will only be unpacked over years.

Gildiner\u0027s account of her journeys with them is moving, insightful, and sometimes very funny. Good Morning Monster offers an almost novelistic, behind-the-scenes look into the therapist\u0027s office, illustrating how the process can heal even the most unimaginable wounds.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e", "custom_clean": 1, "custom_lists": [], "custom_lists_ids": null, "custom_read_date": null, "custom_reading_list": 1, "custom_types": [{"id": 1, "sort": "eBook", "value": "eBook"}], "custom_types_ids": "1", "flags": 1, "has_cover": 1, "id": 266, "identifier_ids": "910,908,909,907", "identifiers": [{"book": 266, "id": 907, "name": "ISBN", "path": "https://www.worldcat.org/isbn/9781250272263", "sort": "isbn", "type": "isbn", "val": "9781250272263"}, {"book": 266, "id": 909, "name": "Google Books", "path": "https://books.google.com/books?id=Hi_QDwAAQBAJ", "sort": "google", "type": "google", "val": "Hi_QDwAAQBAJ"}, {"book": 266, "id": 908, "name": "Goodreads", "path": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/49127514", "sort": "goodreads", "type": "goodreads", "val": "49127514"}, {"book": 266, "id": 910, "name": "Amazon", "path": "https://amazon.com/dp/B084M1M1DZ", "sort": "amazon", "type": "amazon", "val": "B084M1M1DZ"}], "isbn": "9781250272263", "language_ids": "1", "languages": [{"avg_rating": 8.3717277486911, "count": 276, "id": 1, "name": "ENG", "sort": "ENG"}], "last_modified": "2023-05-04 17:55:52.136675+00:00", "order_by": "2023-03-16 21:47:14.891082+00:00", "path": "Catherine Gildiner/Good Morning, Monster_ A Therapist (266)", "pubdate": "2020-09-22", "publisher_ids": "169", "publishers": [{"avg_rating": 8.0, "count": 1, "id": 169, "name": "St. Martin\u0027s Press", "sort": "St. Martin\u0027s Press"}], "rating": 4, "series": [], "series_ids": null, "size": 822130, "tag_ids": "31,43,50,70,92,253,254,255", "tags": [{"avg_rating": 8.432432432432432, "count": 37, "id": 50, "name": "Adult", "sort": 37}, {"avg_rating": 8.222222222222221, "count": 31, "id": 92, "name": "Biography", "sort": 31}, {"avg_rating": 8.0, "count": 27, "id": 43, "name": "Self Help", "sort": 27}, {"avg_rating": 8.0, "count": 20, "id": 31, "name": "Psychology", "sort": 20}, {"avg_rating": 8.0, "count": 7, "id": 70, "name": "Health", "sort": 7}, {"avg_rating": 8.0, "count": 2, "id": 253, "name": "Non-Fiction", "sort": 2}, {"avg_rating": 8.0, "count": 1, "id": 254, "name": "Memoir", "sort": 1}, {"avg_rating": 8.0, "count": 1, "id": 255, "name": "Mental Health", "sort": 1}], "timestamp": "2023-03-16 21:47:14.891082+00:00", "title": "Good Morning, Monster: A Therapist Shares Five Heroic Stories of Emotional Recovery"}, {"author_ids": "338,339", "authors": [{"avg_rating": 8.0, "count": 1, "id": 338, "name": "Alexander Shulgin", "sort": "Shulgin, Alexander"}, {"avg_rating": 8.0, "count": 1, "id": 339, "name": "Ann Shulgin", "sort": "Shulgin, Ann"}], "comments": "\u003cdiv\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlexander (better known as \"Sasha\") and Ann Shulgin\u0027s PiHKAL: A Chemical Love Story has become a foundational work in the genre and was the first book to fully impart the how-to chemistry, and convey the effects, of many of the entheogenic drugs that are currently being studied and used to heal trauma and deal with death. An acronym for \"Phenethylamines I Have Known and Loved\", the book spans autobiography, organic chemistry, politics, ethnobotany, and psychopharmacology, and the cultural impact is likely to be profound for decades to come, as it has already. PiHKAL is divided into two parts, the first of which is a fictionalized autobiographical \u0027novel\u0027 - the main fiction is that it is fiction. This first half of the book is The Love Story, about two people named Shura and Alice who fall in love, though one of them is already in love with someone else. This love triangle is a painful ordeal they must go through, and that process unfolds before the reader with grace and great insight into human nature. Shura is a brilliant chemist who has dedicated his career to making psychoactive drugs, in the story they go through many experiences with the psychedelic compounds that Shura has discovered and has made in his lab, all of which have been bioassayed himself. The reader will find themselves going on this journey with them, experiencing what they experienced, both in their hearts and in the psychedelic journeys they have. The second half of PiHKAL is called The Chemical Story, and it contains detailed instructions for, and effects of, the synthesis of 179 psychedelic phenethylamines which were mostly discovered by Shulgin himself. For each substance there is information on its synthesis, suggested effective dosage, duration, and detailed commentary on the subjective effects that were experienced. This book appeals to adults of all ages and cultures, and to the psychedelically experienced and inexperienced alike.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e", "custom_clean": 1, "custom_lists": [], "custom_lists_ids": null, "custom_read_date": null, "custom_reading_list": 1, "custom_types": [{"id": 1, "sort": "eBook", "value": "eBook"}], "custom_types_ids": "1", "flags": 1, "has_cover": 1, "id": 252, "identifier_ids": "864,865,863", "identifiers": [{"book": 252, "id": 863, "name": "ISBN", "path": "https://www.worldcat.org/isbn/9780963009609", "sort": "isbn", "type": "isbn", "val": "9780963009609"}, {"book": 252, "id": 865, "name": "Google Books", "path": "https://books.google.com/books?id=O8AdHBGybpcC", "sort": "google", "type": "google", "val": "O8AdHBGybpcC"}, {"book": 252, "id": 864, "name": "Goodreads", "path": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/886113", "sort": "goodreads", "type": "goodreads", "val": "886113"}], "isbn": "9780963009609", "language_ids": "1", "languages": [{"avg_rating": 8.3717277486911, "count": 276, "id": 1, "name": "ENG", "sort": "ENG"}], "last_modified": "2023-03-25 22:02:03.254144+00:00", "order_by": "2023-01-03 18:10:07.521546+00:00", "path": "Alexander Shulgin/Pihkal_ A Chemical Love Story (252)", "pubdate": "1990-10-01", "publisher_ids": "153", "publishers": [{"avg_rating": 8.0, "count": 1, "id": 153, "name": "Transform Press", "sort": "Transform Press"}], "rating": 4, "series": [], "series_ids": null, "size": 1271874, "tag_ids": "43,92,239,241,242", "tags": [{"avg_rating": 8.222222222222221, "count": 31, "id": 92, "name": "Biography", "sort": 31}, {"avg_rating": 8.0, "count": 27, "id": 43, "name": "Self Help", "sort": 27}, {"avg_rating": 8.0, "count": 1, "id": 239, "name": "Personal Memoirs", "sort": 1}, {"avg_rating": 8.0, "count": 1, "id": 241, "name": "Substance Abuse \u0026 Addictions", "sort": 1}, {"avg_rating": 8.0, "count": 1, "id": 242, "name": "Drugs", "sort": 1}], "timestamp": "2023-01-03 18:10:07.521546+00:00", "title": "Pihkal: A Chemical Love Story"}, {"author_ids": "335", "authors": [{"avg_rating": 8.0, "count": 1, "id": 335, "name": "Tony Fadell", "sort": "Fadell, Tony"}], "comments": "\u003cdiv\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWritten for anyone who wants to grow at work\u2014from young grads navigating their first jobs to CEOs deciding whether to sell their company\u2014 Build is full of personal stories, practical advice and fascinating insights into some of the most impactful products and people of the 20th century.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEach quick 5-20 page entry builds on the previous one, charting Tony\u2019s personal journey from a product designer to a leader, from a startup founder to an executive to a mentor.

Whether he\u0027s recollecting the influence of the beautiful, strong women who have been his muses, or retracing a journey that has included appearances as diverse as a performance before half a million people at Woodstock or an audience of one at the humble compound of the exiled Dalai Lama, Kiedis shares a compelling story about the price of success and excess.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eScar Tissue is a story of dedication and debauchery, of intrigue and integrity, of recklessness and redemption--a story that could only have come out of the world of rock.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e", "custom_clean": 1, "custom_lists": [], "custom_lists_ids": null, "custom_read_date": null, "custom_reading_list": 0, "custom_types": [{"id": 1, "sort": "eBook", "value": "eBook"}], "custom_types_ids": "1", "flags": 1, "has_cover": 1, "id": 164, "identifier_ids": "607,608,606,605", "identifiers": [{"book": 164, "id": 605, "name": "ISBN", "path": "https://www.worldcat.org/isbn/9788494588655", "sort": "isbn", "type": "isbn", "val": "9788494588655"}, {"book": 164, "id": 606, "name": "Google Books", "path": "https://books.google.com/books?id=X4N-DwAAQBAJ", "sort": "google", "type": "google", "val": "X4N-DwAAQBAJ"}, {"book": 164, "id": 608, "name": "Goodreads", "path": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/96647", "sort": "goodreads", "type": "goodreads", "val": "96647"}, {"book": 164, "id": 607, "name": "Amazon", "path": "https://amazon.com/dp/1401307450", "sort": "amazon", "type": "amazon", "val": "1401307450"}], "isbn": "9788494588655", "language_ids": "1", "languages": [{"avg_rating": 8.3717277486911, "count": 276, "id": 1, "name": "ENG", "sort": "ENG"}], "last_modified": "2023-05-04 17:55:52.136675+00:00", "order_by": "2022-10-06 09:38:14.205357+00:00", "path": "Anthony Kiedis/Scar Tissue (164)", "pubdate": "2004-01-01", "publisher_ids": "91", "publishers": [{"avg_rating": 9.0, "count": 2, "id": 91, "name": "Hachette UK", "sort": "Hachette UK"}], "rating": 4, "series": [], "series_ids": null, "size": 73076128, "tag_ids": "92,132", "tags": [{"avg_rating": 8.222222222222221, "count": 31, "id": 92, "name": "Biography", "sort": 31}, {"avg_rating": 7.6, "count": 6, "id": 132, "name": "Music", "sort": 6}], "timestamp": "2022-10-06 09:38:14.205357+00:00", "title": "Scar Tissue"}, {"author_ids": "167", "authors": [{"avg_rating": 8.0, "count": 1, "id": 167, "name": "George Orwell", "sort": "Orwell, George"}], "comments": "\u003cdiv\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat was a nice Eton boy like Eric Blair doing in scummy slums instead of being upwardly mobile at Oxford or Cambridge? Living Down and Out in Paris and London , repudiating respectable imperialist society, and reinventing himself as George Orwell. His 1933 debut book (ostensibly a novel, but overwhelmingly autobiographical) was rejected by that elitist publisher T. S. Eliot, perhaps because its close-up portrait of lowlife was too pungent for comfort.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn Paris, Orwell lived in verminous rooms and washed dishes at the overpriced \"Hotel X,\" in a remarkably filthy, 110-degree kitchen. He met \"eccentric people \u2013 people who have fallen into solitary, half-mad grooves of life and given up trying to be normal or decent.\" Though Orwell\u0027s tone is that of an outraged reformer, it\u0027s surprising how entertaining many of his adventures are: gnawing poverty only enlivens the imagination, and the wild characters he met often swindled each other and themselves. The wackiest tale involves a miser who ate cats, wore newspapers for underwear, invested 6,000 francs in cocaine, and hid it in a face-powder tin when the cops raided. They had to free him, because the apparently controlled substance turned out to be face powder instead of cocaine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn London, Orwell studied begging with a crippled expert named Bozo, a great storyteller and philosopher. Orwell devotes a chapter to the fine points of London guttersnipe slang. Years later, he would put his lexical bent to work by inventing Newspeak, and draw on his down-and-out experience to evoke the plight of the Proles in 1984. Though marred by hints of unexamined anti-Semitism, Orwell\u0027s debut remains, as The Nation put it, \"the most lucid portrait of poverty in the English language.\" --Tim Appelo\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e", "custom_clean": 1, "custom_lists": [], "custom_lists_ids": null, "custom_read_date": null, "custom_reading_list": 0, "custom_types": [{"id": 1, "sort": "eBook", "value": "eBook"}], "custom_types_ids": "1", "flags": 1, "has_cover": 1, "id": 159, "identifier_ids": "483,484,481,482", "identifiers": [{"book": 159, "id": 482, "name": "ISBN", "path": "https://www.worldcat.org/isbn/9780156262248", "sort": "isbn", "type": "isbn", "val": "9780156262248"}, {"book": 159, "id": 481, "name": "Google Books", "path": "https://books.google.com/books?id=m5vIVN7LjtgC", "sort": "google", "type": "google", "val": "m5vIVN7LjtgC"}, {"book": 159, "id": 484, "name": "Goodreads", "path": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34304872", "sort": "goodreads", "type": "goodreads", "val": "34304872"}, {"book": 159, "id": 483, "name": "Amazon", "path": "https://amazon.com/dp/015626224X", "sort": "amazon", "type": "amazon", "val": "015626224X"}], "isbn": "9780156262248", "language_ids": "1", "languages": [{"avg_rating": 8.3717277486911, "count": 276, "id": 1, "name": "ENG", "sort": "ENG"}], "last_modified": "2023-05-04 17:55:52.136675+00:00", "order_by": "2022-10-06 09:35:53.313990+00:00", "path": "George Orwell/Down and Out in Paris and London (159)", "pubdate": "1933-01-01", "publisher_ids": "90", "publishers": [{"avg_rating": 8.666666666666666, "count": 13, "id": 90, "name": "Penguin Random House", "sort": "Penguin Random House"}], "rating": 4, "series": [], "series_ids": null, "size": 690052, "tag_ids": "57,60,90,92,153", "tags": [{"avg_rating": 8.222222222222221, "count": 31, "id": 92, "name": "Biography", "sort": 31}, {"avg_rating": 8.454545454545455, "count": 24, "id": 60, "name": "History", "sort": 24}, {"avg_rating": 8.347826086956522, "count": 23, "id": 57, "name": "Politics", "sort": 23}, {"avg_rating": 8.1, "count": 14, "id": 153, "name": "Classics", "sort": 14}, {"avg_rating": 7.5, "count": 4, "id": 90, "name": "Travel", "sort": 4}], "timestamp": "2022-10-06 09:35:53.313990+00:00", "title": "Down and Out in Paris and London"}, {"author_ids": "165", "authors": [{"avg_rating": null, "count": 3, "id": 165, "name": "Vincent van Gogh", "sort": "Gogh, Vincent van"}], "comments": "\u003cdiv\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDe brieven van Vincent van Gogh behoren tot de beste kunstenaarsbrieven die ooit zijn geschreven.

Nobody, including the lawmakers who passed the bill, expected it to transform the country\u2019s demographics. But over the next four decades, millions arrived, including Jay Caspian Kang\u2019s parents, grandparents, aunts, and uncles. They came with almost no understanding of their new home, much less the history of \u201cAsian America\u201d that was supposed to define them.\u00a0The Loneliest Americans is the unforgettable story of Kang and his family as they move from a housing project in Cambridge to an idyllic college town in the South and eventually to the West Coast. Their story unfolds against the backdrop of a rapidly expanding Asian America, as millions more immigrants, many of them working-class or undocumented, stream into the country. At the same time, upwardly mobile urban professionals have struggled to reconcile their parents\u2019 assimilationist goals with membership in a multicultural elite\u2014all while trying to carve out a new kind of belonging for their own children, who are neither white nor truly \u201cpeople of color.\u201d\u00a0Kang recognizes this existential loneliness in himself and in other Asian Americans who try to locate themselves in the country\u2019s racial binary. There are the businessmen turning Flushing into a center of immigrant wealth; the casualties of the Los Angeles riots; the impoverished parents in New York City who believe that admission to the city\u2019s exam schools is the only way out; the men\u2019s right\u2019s activists on Reddit ranting about intermarriage; and the handful of protesters who show up at Black Lives Matter rallies holding \u201cYellow Peril Supports Black Power\u201d signs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKang\u2019s exquisitely crafted book brings these lonely parallel climbers together and calls for a new immigrant solidarity\u2014one rooted not in bubble tea and elite college admissions but in the struggles of refugees and the working class.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e", "custom_clean": 1, "custom_lists": [{"id": 5, "sort": "Must Read.2021 Time", "value": "Must Read.2021 Time"}], "custom_lists_ids": "5", "custom_read_date": null, "custom_reading_list": 0, "custom_types": [{"id": 1, "sort": "eBook", "value": "eBook"}], "custom_types_ids": "1", "flags": 1, "has_cover": 1, "id": 137, "identifier_ids": "332,333,331", "identifiers": [{"book": 137, "id": 331, "name": "ISBN", "path": "https://www.worldcat.org/isbn/9780525576242", "sort": "isbn", "type": "isbn", "val": "9780525576242"}, {"book": 137, "id": 333, "name": "Google Books", "path": "https://books.google.com/books?id=vYMvEAAAQBAJ", "sort": "google", "type": "google", "val": "vYMvEAAAQBAJ"}, {"book": 137, "id": 332, "name": "Goodreads", "path": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/58145392", "sort": "goodreads", "type": "goodreads", "val": "58145392"}], "isbn": "9780525576242", "language_ids": "1", "languages": [{"avg_rating": 8.3717277486911, "count": 276, "id": 1, "name": "ENG", "sort": "ENG"}], "last_modified": "2023-05-04 17:55:52.136675+00:00", "order_by": "2022-10-05 15:54:12.577840+00:00", "path": "Jay Caspian Kang/The Loneliest Americans (137)", "pubdate": "2021-10-12", "publisher_ids": "100", "publishers": [{"avg_rating": 8.0, "count": 6, "id": 100, "name": "Crown Publishing Group", "sort": "Crown Publishing Group"}], "rating": 4, "series": [], "series_ids": null, "size": 1727399, "tag_ids": "57,60,92,194", "tags": [{"avg_rating": 8.333333333333334, "count": 40, "id": 194, "name": "Time", "sort": 40}, {"avg_rating": 8.222222222222221, "count": 31, "id": 92, "name": "Biography", "sort": 31}, {"avg_rating": 8.454545454545455, "count": 24, "id": 60, "name": "History", "sort": 24}, {"avg_rating": 8.347826086956522, "count": 23, "id": 57, "name": "Politics", "sort": 23}], "timestamp": "2022-10-05 15:54:12.577840+00:00", "title": "The Loneliest Americans"}, {"author_ids": "154", "authors": [{"avg_rating": 8.0, "count": 1, "id": 154, "name": "Kat Chow", "sort": "Chow, Kat"}], "comments": "\u003cdiv\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBorn two years after her parents\u0027 only son died just hours after his birth, Kat Chow became unusually fixated with death.

The result is an extraordinary new contribution to the literature of grief and the American family, and a provocative and transformative meditation on who we become under the specter of loss.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e", "custom_clean": 1, "custom_lists": [{"id": 5, "sort": "Must Read.2021 Time", "value": "Must Read.2021 Time"}], "custom_lists_ids": "5", "custom_read_date": null, "custom_reading_list": 0, "custom_types": [{"id": 1, "sort": "eBook", "value": "eBook"}], "custom_types_ids": "1", "flags": 1, "has_cover": 1, "id": 135, "identifier_ids": "324,325,327,326", "identifiers": [{"book": 135, "id": 326, "name": "ISBN", "path": "https://www.worldcat.org/isbn/9781538716304", "sort": "isbn", "type": "isbn", "val": "9781538716304"}, {"book": 135, "id": 327, "name": "Google Books", "path": "https://books.google.com/books?id=6WrhDwAAQBAJ", "sort": "google", "type": "google", "val": "6WrhDwAAQBAJ"}, {"book": 135, "id": 325, "name": "Goodreads", "path": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/53376379", "sort": "goodreads", "type": "goodreads", "val": "53376379"}, {"book": 135, "id": 324, "name": "Amazon", "path": "https://amazon.com/dp/1538716321", "sort": "amazon", "type": "amazon", "val": "1538716321"}], "isbn": "9781538716304", "language_ids": "1", "languages": [{"avg_rating": 8.3717277486911, "count": 276, "id": 1, "name": "ENG", "sort": "ENG"}], "last_modified": "2023-05-04 17:55:52.136675+00:00", "order_by": "2022-10-05 15:54:11.863737+00:00", "path": "Kat Chow/Seeing Ghosts_ A Memoir (135)", "pubdate": "2021-08-24", "publisher_ids": "11", "publishers": [{"avg_rating": 9.0, "count": 2, "id": 11, "name": "Grand Central Publishing", "sort": "Grand Central Publishing"}], "rating": 4, "series": [], "series_ids": null, "size": 12348449, "tag_ids": "50,92,194", "tags": [{"avg_rating": 8.333333333333334, "count": 40, "id": 194, "name": "Time", "sort": 40}, {"avg_rating": 8.432432432432432, "count": 37, "id": 50, "name": "Adult", "sort": 37}, {"avg_rating": 8.222222222222221, "count": 31, "id": 92, "name": "Biography", "sort": 31}], "timestamp": "2022-10-05 15:54:11.863737+00:00", "title": "Seeing Ghosts: A Memoir"}, {"author_ids": "135", "authors": [{"avg_rating": 8.0, "count": 1, "id": 135, "name": "Larissa Pham", "sort": "Pham, Larissa"}], "comments": "\u003cdiv\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"A warm and expansive portrait of a woman\u2019s mind that feels at once singular and universal,\" this collection of essays interweaves commentary on modern life, feminism, art, and sex with the author\u0027s own experiences of obsession, heartbreak, and vulnerability (BuzzFeed).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLike a song that feels written just for you, Larissa Pham\u0027s debut work of nonfiction captures the imagination and refuses to let go. Pop Song is a book about love and about falling in love\u2014with a place, or a painting, or a person\u2014and the joy and terror inherent in the experience of that love. Plumbing the well of culture for clues and patterns about love and loss\u2014from Agnes Martin\u0027s abstract paintings to James Turrell\u0027s transcendent light works, and Anne Carson\u0027s Eros the Bittersweet to Frank Ocean\u0027s Blonde\u2014Pham writes of her youthful attempts to find meaning in travel, sex, drugs, and art, before sensing that she might need to turn her gaze upon herself. Pop Song is also a book about distances, near and far. As she travels from Taos, New Mexico, to Shanghai, China and beyond, Pham meditates on the miles we are willing to cover to get away from ourselves, or those who hurt us, and the impossible gaps that can exist between two people sharing a bed. Pop Song is a book about all the routes by which we might escape our own needs before finally finding a way home. There is heartache in these pages, but Pham\u0027s electric ways of seeing create a perfectly fractured portrait of modern intimacy that is triumphant in both its vulnerability and restlessness. \"Each of the essays in this debut collection reads like a mini-memoir ... in which the author reflects on her experiences of young love, trauma, and transcendence through discussions of art and music ... with an intimacy that is at once tender and expansive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\" \u2014New York magazine\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e", "custom_clean": 1, "custom_lists": [{"id": 5, "sort": "Must Read.2021 Time", "value": "Must Read.2021 Time"}], "custom_lists_ids": "5", "custom_read_date": null, "custom_reading_list": 0, "custom_types": [{"id": 1, "sort": "eBook", "value": "eBook"}], "custom_types_ids": "1", "flags": 1, "has_cover": 1, "id": 133, "identifier_ids": "320,318,319", "identifiers": [{"book": 133, "id": 319, "name": "ISBN", "path": "https://www.worldcat.org/isbn/9781646220274", "sort": "isbn", "type": "isbn", "val": "9781646220274"}, {"book": 133, "id": 318, "name": "Google Books", "path": "https://books.google.com/books?id=V6UQEAAAQBAJ", "sort": "google", "type": "google", "val": "V6UQEAAAQBAJ"}, {"book": 133, "id": 320, "name": "Goodreads", "path": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/60057391", "sort": "goodreads", "type": "goodreads", "val": "60057391"}], "isbn": "9781646220274", "language_ids": "1", "languages": [{"avg_rating": 8.3717277486911, "count": 276, "id": 1, "name": "ENG", "sort": "ENG"}], "last_modified": "2023-05-04 17:55:52.136675+00:00", "order_by": "2022-10-05 15:54:11.131714+00:00", "path": "Larissa Pham/Pop Song_ Adventures in Art \u0026 Intim (133)", "pubdate": "2021-05-04", "publisher_ids": "77", "publishers": [{"avg_rating": 8.0, "count": 1, "id": 77, "name": "Catapult", "sort": "Catapult"}], "rating": 4, "series": [], "series_ids": null, "size": 1035488, "tag_ids": "44,49,92,132,133,194", "tags": [{"avg_rating": 8.89655172413793, "count": 51, "id": 49, "name": "Contemporary", "sort": 51}, {"avg_rating": 8.333333333333334, "count": 40, "id": 194, "name": "Time", "sort": 40}, {"avg_rating": 8.222222222222221, "count": 31, "id": 92, "name": "Biography", "sort": 31}, {"avg_rating": 8.0, "count": 6, "id": 44, "name": "Art", "sort": 6}, {"avg_rating": 7.6, "count": 6, "id": 132, "name": "Music", "sort": 6}, {"avg_rating": 8.333333333333334, "count": 6, "id": 133, "name": "Feminism", "sort": 6}], "timestamp": "2022-10-05 15:54:11.131714+00:00", "title": "Pop Song: Adventures in Art \u0026 Intimacy"}, {"author_ids": "133,153", "authors": [{"avg_rating": 8.0, "count": 1, "id": 133, "name": "Melissa Febos", "sort": "Febos, Melissa"}, {"avg_rating": 8.0, "count": 1, "id": 153, "name": "Forsyth Harmon", "sort": "Harmon, Forsyth"}], "comments": "\u003cdiv\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA gripping set of stories about the forces that shape girls and the adults they become.

Next he directed four consecutive hit plays, won back-to-back Tonys, ushered in a new era of Hollywood moviemaking with Who\u0027s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?, and followed it with The Graduate, which won him an Oscar and became the third-highest-grossing movie ever.

It would take decades for him to come to grips with his demons. In an incomparable portrait that follows Nichols from Berlin to New York to Chicago to Hollywood, Mark Harris explores, with brilliantly vivid detail and insight, the life, work, struggle, and passion of an artist and man in constant motion. Among the 250 people Harris interviewed: Elaine May, Meryl Streep, Stephen Sondheim, Robert Redford, Glenn Close, Tom Hanks, Candice Bergen, Emma Thompson, Annette Bening, Natalie Portman, Julia Roberts, Lorne Michaels, and Gloria Steinem.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMark Harris gives an intimate and evenhanded accounting of success and failure alike; the portrait is not always flattering, but its ultimate impact is to present the full story of one of the most richly interesting, complicated, and consequential figures the worlds of theater and motion pictures have ever seen.

Just as she and her family settled into a new home, her father would tell them it was time to say their goodbyes. The instability wrought by Nadia\u2019s nomadic childhood was deepened by family secrets and fractures, both lived and inherited. Her Armenian American mother, who abandoned Nadia when she was two, would periodically reappear, only to vanish again. Her father, a Ghanaian, the great hero of her life, died when she was thirteen. After his passing, Nadia\u2019s stepmother weighed her down with a revelation that was either a bombshell secret or a lie, rife with shaming innuendo. With these and other ruptures, Nadia arrived in New York as a young woman feeling stateless, motherless, and uncertain about her future, yet eager to find her own identity. What followed, however, were periods of depression in which she struggled to hold herself and her siblings together. \u201cA magnificent, complex assessment of selfhood and why it matters\u201d (Elle), Aftershocks depicts the way she hauled herself from the wreckage of her life\u2019s perpetual quaking, the means by which she has finally come to understand that the only ground firm enough to count on is the one written into existence by her own hand. \u201cFull of narrative risk and untrammeled lyricism\u201d (The Washington Post), Aftershocks joins the likes of Don\u2019t Let\u2019s Go to the Dogs Tonight and William Styron\u2019s Darkness Visible, and does for race identity what Maggie Nelson does for gender identity in The Argonauts.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e", "custom_clean": 1, "custom_lists": [{"id": 5, "sort": "Must Read.2021 Time", "value": "Must Read.2021 Time"}], "custom_lists_ids": "5", "custom_read_date": null, "custom_reading_list": 0, "custom_types": [{"id": 1, "sort": "eBook", "value": "eBook"}], "custom_types_ids": "1", "flags": 1, "has_cover": 1, "id": 127, "identifier_ids": "415,416", "identifiers": [{"book": 127, "id": 416, "name": "ISBN", "path": "https://www.worldcat.org/isbn/9781982111236", "sort": "isbn", "type": "isbn", "val": "9781982111236"}, {"book": 127, "id": 415, "name": "Google Books", "path": "https://books.google.com/books?id=VBQ3EAAAQBAJ", "sort": "google", "type": "google", "val": "VBQ3EAAAQBAJ"}], "isbn": "9781982111236", "language_ids": "1", "languages": [{"avg_rating": 8.3717277486911, "count": 276, "id": 1, "name": "ENG", "sort": "ENG"}], "last_modified": "2023-05-04 17:55:52.136675+00:00", "order_by": "2022-10-05 15:54:08.709178+00:00", "path": "Nadia Owusu/Aftershocks_ A Memoir (127)", "pubdate": "2021-08-03", "publisher_ids": "22", "publishers": [{"avg_rating": 8.0, "count": 6, "id": 22, "name": "Simon \u0026 Schuster", "sort": "Simon \u0026 Schuster"}], "rating": null, "series": [], "series_ids": null, "size": 3951047, "tag_ids": "92,119,120,150,194,331", "tags": [{"avg_rating": 8.333333333333334, "count": 40, "id": 194, "name": "Time", "sort": 40}, {"avg_rating": 8.222222222222221, "count": 31, "id": 92, "name": "Biography", "sort": 31}, {"avg_rating": 10.0, "count": 5, "id": 331, "name": "Girls \u0026 Women", "sort": 5}, {"avg_rating": 10.0, "count": 2, "id": 119, "name": "Ethnic \u0026 Regional", "sort": 2}, {"avg_rating": 10.0, "count": 2, "id": 120, "name": "African American \u0026 Black", "sort": 2}, {"avg_rating": null, "count": 1, "id": 150, "name": "Cultural", "sort": 1}], "timestamp": "2022-10-05 15:54:08.709178+00:00", "title": "Aftershocks: A Memoir"}, {"author_ids": "126", "authors": [{"avg_rating": 10.0, "count": 1, "id": 126, "name": "Patrick Radden Keefe", "sort": "Keefe, Patrick Radden"}], "comments": "\u003cdiv\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNATIONAL BOOK CRITICS CIRCLE NOMINEE \u2022 A NEW YORK TIMES NOTABLE\u00a0BOOK OF THE YEAR \u2022 NEW YORK TIMES BEST SELLER \u2022 A grand, devastating portrait of three generations of the Sackler family, famed for their philanthropy, whose fortune was built by Valium and whose reputation was destroyed by OxyContin. From the prize-winning and bestselling author of Say Nothing The history of the Sackler dynasty is rife with drama\u2014baroque personal lives; bitter disputes over estates; fistfights in boardrooms; glittering art collections; Machiavellian courtroom maneuvers; and the calculated use of money to burnish reputations and crush the less powerful.\u00a0The Sackler name has adorned the walls of many storied institutions\u2014Harvard, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Oxford, the Louvre. They are one of the richest families in the world, known for their lavish donations to the arts and the sciences. The source of the family fortune was vague, however, until it emerged that the Sacklers were responsible for making and marketing a blockbuster painkiller that was the catalyst for the opioid crisis. Empire of Pain begins with the story of three doctor brothers, Raymond, Mortimer and the incalculably energetic Arthur, who weathered the poverty of the Great Depression and appalling anti-Semitism. Working at a barbaric mental institution, Arthur saw a better way and conducted groundbreaking research into drug treatments. He also had a genius for marketing, especially for pharmaceuticals, and bought a small ad firm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eArthur devised the marketing for Valium, and built the first great Sackler fortune. He purchased a drug manufacturer, Purdue Frederick, which would be run by Raymond and Mortimer. The brothers began collecting art, and wives, and grand residences in exotic locales. Their children and grandchildren grew up in luxury.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eForty years later, Raymond\u2019s son Richard ran the family-owned Purdue. The template Arthur Sackler created to sell Valium\u2014co-opting doctors, influencing the FDA, downplaying the drug\u2019s addictiveness\u2014was employed to launch a far more potent product: OxyContin. The drug went on to generate some thirty-five billion dollars in revenue, and to launch a public health crisis in which hundreds of thousands would die. This is the saga of three generations of a single family and the mark they would leave on the world, a tale that moves from the bustling streets of early twentieth-century Brooklyn to the seaside palaces\u00a0of Greenwich, Connecticut, and Cap d\u2019Antibes to the corridors of power in Washington, D.C.\u00a0 Empire of Pain chronicles the multiple investigations of the Sacklers and their company, and the scorched-earth legal tactics that the family has used to evade accountability.\u00a0Empire of Pain is a masterpiece of narrative reporting and writing, exhaustively documented and ferociously compelling. It is a portrait of the excesses of America\u2019s second Gilded Age, a study of impunity among the super elite and a relentless investigation of the naked greed and indifference to human suffering that built one of the world\u2019s great fortunes.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e", "custom_clean": 1, "custom_lists": [{"id": 5, "sort": "Must Read.2021 Time", "value": "Must Read.2021 Time"}], "custom_lists_ids": "5", "custom_read_date": null, "custom_reading_list": 0, "custom_types": [{"id": 1, "sort": "eBook", "value": "eBook"}], "custom_types_ids": "1", "flags": 1, "has_cover": 1, "id": 124, "identifier_ids": "408,406,407", "identifiers": [{"book": 124, "id": 407, "name": "ISBN", "path": "https://www.worldcat.org/isbn/9780385545693", "sort": "isbn", "type": "isbn", "val": "9780385545693"}, {"book": 124, "id": 406, "name": "Google Books", "path": "https://books.google.com/books?id=Qb4IEAAAQBAJ", "sort": "google", "type": "google", "val": "Qb4IEAAAQBAJ"}, {"book": 124, "id": 408, "name": "Goodreads", "path": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43868109", "sort": "goodreads", "type": "goodreads", "val": "43868109"}], "isbn": "9780385545693", "language_ids": "1", "languages": [{"avg_rating": 8.3717277486911, "count": 276, "id": 1, "name": "ENG", "sort": "ENG"}], "last_modified": "2023-05-04 17:55:52.136675+00:00", "order_by": "2022-10-05 15:54:07.602947+00:00", "path": "Patrick Radden Keefe/Empire of Pain_ The Secret History (124)", "pubdate": "2021-04-13", "publisher_ids": "82", "publishers": [{"avg_rating": 8.666666666666666, "count": 3, "id": 82, "name": "Knopf Publishing Group", "sort": "Knopf Publishing Group"}], "rating": 5, "series": [], "series_ids": null, "size": 5759595, "tag_ids": "51,57,58,60,92,194", "tags": [{"avg_rating": 8.333333333333334, "count": 40, "id": 194, "name": "Time", "sort": 40}, {"avg_rating": 8.222222222222221, "count": 31, "id": 92, "name": "Biography", "sort": 31}, {"avg_rating": 8.454545454545455, "count": 24, "id": 60, "name": "History", "sort": 24}, {"avg_rating": 8.347826086956522, "count": 23, "id": 57, "name": "Politics", "sort": 23}, {"avg_rating": 8.363636363636363, "count": 12, "id": 51, "name": "Business", "sort": 12}, {"avg_rating": 8.4, "count": 12, "id": 58, "name": "Science", "sort": 12}], "timestamp": "2022-10-05 15:54:07.602947+00:00", "title": "Empire of Pain: The Secret History of the Sackler Dynasty"}, {"author_ids": "124", "authors": [{"avg_rating": 8.0, "count": 1, "id": 124, "name": "Suzanne Simard", "sort": "Simard, Suzanne"}], "comments": "\u003cdiv\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuzanne Simard is a pioneer on the frontier of plant communication and intelligence; she\u0027s been compared to Rachel Carson, hailed as a scientist who conveys complex, technical ideas in a way that is dazzling and profound.

Childhood tells the story of a misfit child\u0027s single-minded determination to become a poet; Youth describes her early experiences of sex, work, and independence. Dependency picks up the story as the narrator embarks on the first of her four marriages and goes on to describe her horrible descent into drug addiction, enabled by her sinister, gaslighting doctor-husband.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThroughout, the narrator grapples with the tension between her vocation as a writer and her competing roles as daughter, wife, mother, and drug addict, and she writes about female experience and identity in a way that feels very fresh and pertinent to today\u0027s discussions around feminism. Ditlevsen\u0027s trilogy is remarkable for its intensity and its immersive depiction of a world of complex female friendships, family and growing up--in this sense, it\u0027s Copenhagen\u0027s answer to Elena Ferrante\u0027s Neapolitan Novels. She can also be seen as a spiritual forerunner of confessional writers like Karl Ove Knausgaard, Annie Ernaux, Rachel Cusk and Deborah Levy.

In these pages, she has gorgeously captured both the privilege of being given access to the inner chambers of people\u0027s lives, and the meaning that comes from watching them grow into the selves they were meant to be.\" \u2014 Lori Gottlieb, New York Times bestselling author of** Maybe You Should Talk to Someone\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn this fascinating narrative, therapist Catherine Gildiner\u2019s presents five of what she calls her most heroic and memorable patients. Among them: a successful, first generation Chinese immigrant musician suffering sexual dysfunction; a young woman whose father abandoned her at age nine with her younger siblings in an isolated cottage in the depth of winter; and a glamorous workaholic whose narcissistic, negligent mother greeted her each morning of her childhood with \"Good morning, Monster.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEach patient presents a mystery, one that will only be unpacked over years.

An acronym for \"Phenethylamines I Have Known and Loved\", the book spans autobiography, organic chemistry, politics, ethnobotany, and psychopharmacology, and the cultural impact is likely to be profound for decades to come, as it has already. PiHKAL is divided into two parts, the first of which is a fictionalized autobiographical \u0027novel\u0027 - the main fiction is that it is fiction. This first half of the book is The Love Story, about two people named Shura and Alice who fall in love, though one of them is already in love with someone else. This love triangle is a painful ordeal they must go through, and that process unfolds before the reader with grace and great insight into human nature. Shura is a brilliant chemist who has dedicated his career to making psychoactive drugs, in the story they go through many experiences with the psychedelic compounds that Shura has discovered and has made in his lab, all of which have been bioassayed himself. The reader will find themselves going on this journey with them, experiencing what they experienced, both in their hearts and in the psychedelic journeys they have. The second half of PiHKAL is called The Chemical Story, and it contains detailed instructions for, and effects of, the synthesis of 179 psychedelic phenethylamines which were mostly discovered by Shulgin himself. For each substance there is information on its synthesis, suggested effective dosage, duration, and detailed commentary on the subjective effects that were experienced. This book appeals to adults of all ages and cultures, and to the psychedelically experienced and inexperienced alike.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e", "custom_clean": 1, "custom_lists": [], "custom_lists_ids": null, "custom_read_date": null, "custom_reading_list": 1, "custom_types": [{"id": 1, "sort": "eBook", "value": "eBook"}], "custom_types_ids": "1", "flags": 1, "has_cover": 1, "id": 252, "identifier_ids": "864,865,863", "identifiers": [{"book": 252, "id": 863, "name": "ISBN", "path": "https://www.worldcat.org/isbn/9780963009609", "sort": "isbn", "type": "isbn", "val": "9780963009609"}, {"book": 252, "id": 865, "name": "Google Books", "path": "https://books.google.com/books?id=O8AdHBGybpcC", "sort": "google", "type": "google", "val": "O8AdHBGybpcC"}, {"book": 252, "id": 864, "name": "Goodreads", "path": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/886113", "sort": "goodreads", "type": "goodreads", "val": "886113"}], "isbn": "9780963009609", "language_ids": "1", "languages": [{"avg_rating": 8.3717277486911, "count": 276, "id": 1, "name": "ENG", "sort": "ENG"}], "last_modified": "2023-03-25 22:02:03.254144+00:00", "order_by": "2023-01-03 18:10:07.521546+00:00", "path": "Alexander Shulgin/Pihkal_ A Chemical Love Story (252)", "pubdate": "1990-10-01", "publisher_ids": "153", "publishers": [{"avg_rating": 8.0, "count": 1, "id": 153, "name": "Transform Press", "sort": "Transform Press"}], "rating": 4, "series": [], "series_ids": null, "size": 1271874, "tag_ids": "43,92,239,241,242", "tags": [{"avg_rating": 8.222222222222221, "count": 31, "id": 92, "name": "Biography", "sort": 31}, {"avg_rating": 8.0, "count": 27, "id": 43, "name": "Self Help", "sort": 27}, {"avg_rating": 8.0, "count": 1, "id": 239, "name": "Personal Memoirs", "sort": 1}, {"avg_rating": 8.0, "count": 1, "id": 241, "name": "Substance Abuse \u0026 Addictions", "sort": 1}, {"avg_rating": 8.0, "count": 1, "id": 242, "name": "Drugs", "sort": 1}], "timestamp": "2023-01-03 18:10:07.521546+00:00", "title": "Pihkal: A Chemical Love Story"}, {"author_ids": "335", "authors": [{"avg_rating": 8.0, "count": 1, "id": 335, "name": "Tony Fadell", "sort": "Fadell, Tony"}], "comments": "\u003cdiv\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWritten for anyone who wants to grow at work\u2014from young grads navigating their first jobs to CEOs deciding whether to sell their company\u2014 Build is full of personal stories, practical advice and fascinating insights into some of the most impactful products and people of the 20th century.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEach quick 5-20 page entry builds on the previous one, charting Tony\u2019s personal journey from a product designer to a leader, from a startup founder to an executive to a mentor.

Living Down and Out in Paris and London , repudiating respectable imperialist society, and reinventing himself as George Orwell. His 1933 debut book (ostensibly a novel, but overwhelmingly autobiographical) was rejected by that elitist publisher T. S. Eliot, perhaps because its close-up portrait of lowlife was too pungent for comfort.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn Paris, Orwell lived in verminous rooms and washed dishes at the overpriced \"Hotel X,\" in a remarkably filthy, 110-degree kitchen. He met \"eccentric people \u2013 people who have fallen into solitary, half-mad grooves of life and given up trying to be normal or decent.\" Though Orwell\u0027s tone is that of an outraged reformer, it\u0027s surprising how entertaining many of his adventures are: gnawing poverty only enlivens the imagination, and the wild characters he met often swindled each other and themselves. The wackiest tale involves a miser who ate cats, wore newspapers for underwear, invested 6,000 francs in cocaine, and hid it in a face-powder tin when the cops raided. They had to free him, because the apparently controlled substance turned out to be face powder instead of cocaine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn London, Orwell studied begging with a crippled expert named Bozo, a great storyteller and philosopher. Orwell devotes a chapter to the fine points of London guttersnipe slang. Years later, he would put his lexical bent to work by inventing Newspeak, and draw on his down-and-out experience to evoke the plight of the Proles in 1984. Though marred by hints of unexamined anti-Semitism, Orwell\u0027s debut remains, as The Nation put it, \"the most lucid portrait of poverty in the English language.\" --Tim Appelo\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e", "custom_clean": 1, "custom_lists": [], "custom_lists_ids": null, "custom_read_date": null, "custom_reading_list": 0, "custom_types": [{"id": 1, "sort": "eBook", "value": "eBook"}], "custom_types_ids": "1", "flags": 1, "has_cover": 1, "id": 159, "identifier_ids": "483,484,481,482", "identifiers": [{"book": 159, "id": 482, "name": "ISBN", "path": "https://www.worldcat.org/isbn/9780156262248", "sort": "isbn", "type": "isbn", "val": "9780156262248"}, {"book": 159, "id": 481, "name": "Google Books", "path": "https://books.google.com/books?id=m5vIVN7LjtgC", "sort": "google", "type": "google", "val": "m5vIVN7LjtgC"}, {"book": 159, "id": 484, "name": "Goodreads", "path": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34304872", "sort": "goodreads", "type": "goodreads", "val": "34304872"}, {"book": 159, "id": 483, "name": "Amazon", "path": "https://amazon.com/dp/015626224X", "sort": "amazon", "type": "amazon", "val": "015626224X"}], "isbn": "9780156262248", "language_ids": "1", "languages": [{"avg_rating": 8.3717277486911, "count": 276, "id": 1, "name": "ENG", "sort": "ENG"}], "last_modified": "2023-05-04 17:55:52.136675+00:00", "order_by": "2022-10-06 09:35:53.313990+00:00", "path": "George Orwell/Down and Out in Paris and London (159)", "pubdate": "1933-01-01", "publisher_ids": "90", "publishers": [{"avg_rating": 8.666666666666666, "count": 13, "id": 90, "name": "Penguin Random House", "sort": "Penguin Random House"}], "rating": 4, "series": [], "series_ids": null, "size": 690052, "tag_ids": "57,60,90,92,153", "tags": [{"avg_rating": 8.222222222222221, "count": 31, "id": 92, "name": "Biography", "sort": 31}, {"avg_rating": 8.454545454545455, "count": 24, "id": 60, "name": "History", "sort": 24}, {"avg_rating": 8.347826086956522, "count": 23, "id": 57, "name": "Politics", "sort": 23}, {"avg_rating": 8.1, "count": 14, "id": 153, "name": "Classics", "sort": 14}, {"avg_rating": 7.5, "count": 4, "id": 90, "name": "Travel", "sort": 4}], "timestamp": "2022-10-06 09:35:53.313990+00:00", "title": "Down and Out in Paris and London"}, {"author_ids": "165", "authors": [{"avg_rating": null, "count": 3, "id": 165, "name": "Vincent van Gogh", "sort": "Gogh, Vincent van"}], "comments": "\u003cdiv\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDe brieven van Vincent van Gogh behoren tot de beste kunstenaarsbrieven die ooit zijn geschreven.

No one in her family, in either the United States or Colombia, spoke of infectious diseases, and even into her thirties, she only knew that her aunt had died of a rare illness called Chagas. But as Hern\u00e1ndez dug deeper, she discovered that Chagas\u2014or the kissing bug disease\u2014is more prevalent in the United States than the Zika virus. Today, more than three hundred thousand Americans have Chagas.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy do some infectious diseases make headlines and others fall by the wayside? After her aunt\u0027s death, Hern\u00e1ndez begins searching for answers about who our nation chooses to take care of and who we ignore. Crisscrossing the country, she interviews patients, epidemiologists, and even veterinarians with the Department of Defense. She learns that outside of Latin America, the United States is the only country with the native insects\u2014the \"kissing bugs\"\u2014that carry the Chagas parasite. She spends a night in southwest Texas hunting the dreaded bug with university researchers. She also gets to know patients, like a mother whose premature baby was born infected with the parasite, his heart already damaged. And she meets one cardiologist battling the disease in Los Angeles County with local volunteers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Kissing Bug tells the story of how poverty, racism, and public policies have conspired to keep this disease hidden\u2014and how the disease intersects with Hern\u00e1ndez\u0027s own identity as a niece, sister, and daughter; a queer woman; a writer and researcher; and a citizen of a country that is only beginning to address the harms caused by Chagas and the dangers it poses.

Nobody, including the lawmakers who passed the bill, expected it to transform the country\u2019s demographics. But over the next four decades, millions arrived, including Jay Caspian Kang\u2019s parents, grandparents, aunts, and uncles. They came with almost no understanding of their new home, much less the history of \u201cAsian America\u201d that was supposed to define them.\u00a0The Loneliest Americans is the unforgettable story of Kang and his family as they move from a housing project in Cambridge to an idyllic college town in the South and eventually to the West Coast.

One morning, when Kat was nine, her mother, a vivacious and mischievous woman, casually made a morbid joke: When she eventually dies, she said laughing, she\u0027d like to be stuffed and displayed in Kat\u0027s future apartment in order to always watch over her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFour years later when her mother dies unexpectedly from cancer, Kat, her two older sisters, and their father are plunged into a debilitating, lonely grief.

Pop Song is a book about love and about falling in love\u2014with a place, or a painting, or a person\u2014and the joy and terror inherent in the experience of that love. Plumbing the well of culture for clues and patterns about love and loss\u2014from Agnes Martin\u0027s abstract paintings to James Turrell\u0027s transcendent light works, and Anne Carson\u0027s Eros the Bittersweet to Frank Ocean\u0027s Blonde\u2014Pham writes of her youthful attempts to find meaning in travel, sex, drugs, and art, before sensing that she might need to turn her gaze upon herself. Pop Song is also a book about distances, near and far. As she travels from Taos, New Mexico, to Shanghai, China and beyond, Pham meditates on the miles we are willing to cover to get away from ourselves, or those who hurt us, and the impossible gaps that can exist between two people sharing a bed. Pop Song is a book about all the routes by which we might escape our own needs before finally finding a way home. There is heartache in these pages, but Pham\u0027s electric ways of seeing create a perfectly fractured portrait of modern intimacy that is triumphant in both its vulnerability and restlessness. \"Each of the essays in this debut collection reads like a mini-memoir ... in which the author reflects on her experiences of young love, trauma, and transcendence through discussions of art and music ... with an intimacy that is at once tender and expansive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\" \u2014New York magazine\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e", "custom_clean": 1, "custom_lists": [{"id": 5, "sort": "Must Read.2021 Time", "value": "Must Read.2021 Time"}], "custom_lists_ids": "5", "custom_read_date": null, "custom_reading_list": 0, "custom_types": [{"id": 1, "sort": "eBook", "value": "eBook"}], "custom_types_ids": "1", "flags": 1, "has_cover": 1, "id": 133, "identifier_ids": "320,318,319", "identifiers": [{"book": 133, "id": 319, "name": "ISBN", "path": "https://www.worldcat.org/isbn/9781646220274", "sort": "isbn", "type": "isbn", "val": "9781646220274"}, {"book": 133, "id": 318, "name": "Google Books", "path": "https://books.google.com/books?id=V6UQEAAAQBAJ", "sort": "google", "type": "google", "val": "V6UQEAAAQBAJ"}, {"book": 133, "id": 320, "name": "Goodreads", "path": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/60057391", "sort": "goodreads", "type": "goodreads", "val": "60057391"}], "isbn": "9781646220274", "language_ids": "1", "languages": [{"avg_rating": 8.3717277486911, "count": 276, "id": 1, "name": "ENG", "sort": "ENG"}], "last_modified": "2023-05-04 17:55:52.136675+00:00", "order_by": "2022-10-05 15:54:11.131714+00:00", "path": "Larissa Pham/Pop Song_ Adventures in Art \u0026 Intim (133)", "pubdate": "2021-05-04", "publisher_ids": "77", "publishers": [{"avg_rating": 8.0, "count": 1, "id": 77, "name": "Catapult", "sort": "Catapult"}], "rating": 4, "series": [], "series_ids": null, "size": 1035488, "tag_ids": "44,49,92,132,133,194", "tags": [{"avg_rating": 8.89655172413793, "count": 51, "id": 49, "name": "Contemporary", "sort": 51}, {"avg_rating": 8.333333333333334, "count": 40, "id": 194, "name": "Time", "sort": 40}, {"avg_rating": 8.222222222222221, "count": 31, "id": 92, "name": "Biography", "sort": 31}, {"avg_rating": 8.0, "count": 6, "id": 44, "name": "Art", "sort": 6}, {"avg_rating": 7.6, "count": 6, "id": 132, "name": "Music", "sort": 6}, {"avg_rating": 8.333333333333334, "count": 6, "id": 133, "name": "Feminism", "sort": 6}], "timestamp": "2022-10-05 15:54:11.131714+00:00", "title": "Pop Song: Adventures in Art \u0026 Intimacy"}, {"author_ids": "133,153", "authors": [{"avg_rating": 8.0, "count": 1, "id": 133, "name": "Melissa Febos", "sort": "Febos, Melissa"}, {"avg_rating": 8.0, "count": 1, "id": 153, "name": "Forsyth Harmon", "sort": "Harmon, Forsyth"}], "comments": "\u003cdiv\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA gripping set of stories about the forces that shape girls and the adults they become.

Next he directed four consecutive hit plays, won back-to-back Tonys, ushered in a new era of Hollywood moviemaking with Who\u0027s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?, and followed it with The Graduate, which won him an Oscar and became the third-highest-grossing movie ever.

It would take decades for him to come to grips with his demons. In an incomparable portrait that follows Nichols from Berlin to New York to Chicago to Hollywood, Mark Harris explores, with brilliantly vivid detail and insight, the life, work, struggle, and passion of an artist and man in constant motion.

Just as she and her family settled into a new home, her father would tell them it was time to say their goodbyes. The instability wrought by Nadia\u2019s nomadic childhood was deepened by family secrets and fractures, both lived and inherited. Her Armenian American mother, who abandoned Nadia when she was two, would periodically reappear, only to vanish again. Her father, a Ghanaian, the great hero of her life, died when she was thirteen. After his passing, Nadia\u2019s stepmother weighed her down with a revelation that was either a bombshell secret or a lie, rife with shaming innuendo. With these and other ruptures, Nadia arrived in New York as a young woman feeling stateless, motherless, and uncertain about her future, yet eager to find her own identity. What followed, however, were periods of depression in which she struggled to hold herself and her siblings together. \u201cA magnificent, complex assessment of selfhood and why it matters\u201d (Elle), Aftershocks depicts the way she hauled herself from the wreckage of her life\u2019s perpetual quaking, the means by which she has finally come to understand that the only ground firm enough to count on is the one written into existence by her own hand. \u201cFull of narrative risk and untrammeled lyricism\u201d (The Washington Post), Aftershocks joins the likes of Don\u2019t Let\u2019s Go to the Dogs Tonight and William Styron\u2019s Darkness Visible, and does for race identity what Maggie Nelson does for gender identity in The Argonauts.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e", "custom_clean": 1, "custom_lists": [{"id": 5, "sort": "Must Read.2021 Time", "value": "Must Read.2021 Time"}], "custom_lists_ids": "5", "custom_read_date": null, "custom_reading_list": 0, "custom_types": [{"id": 1, "sort": "eBook", "value": "eBook"}], "custom_types_ids": "1", "flags": 1, "has_cover": 1, "id": 127, "identifier_ids": "415,416", "identifiers": [{"book": 127, "id": 416, "name": "ISBN", "path": "https://www.worldcat.org/isbn/9781982111236", "sort": "isbn", "type": "isbn", "val": "9781982111236"}, {"book": 127, "id": 415, "name": "Google Books", "path": "https://books.google.com/books?id=VBQ3EAAAQBAJ", "sort": "google", "type": "google", "val": "VBQ3EAAAQBAJ"}], "isbn": "9781982111236", "language_ids": "1", "languages": [{"avg_rating": 8.3717277486911, "count": 276, "id": 1, "name": "ENG", "sort": "ENG"}], "last_modified": "2023-05-04 17:55:52.136675+00:00", "order_by": "2022-10-05 15:54:08.709178+00:00", "path": "Nadia Owusu/Aftershocks_ A Memoir (127)", "pubdate": "2021-08-03", "publisher_ids": "22", "publishers": [{"avg_rating": 8.0, "count": 6, "id": 22, "name": "Simon \u0026 Schuster", "sort": "Simon \u0026 Schuster"}], "rating": null, "series": [], "series_ids": null, "size": 3951047, "tag_ids": "92,119,120,150,194,331", "tags": [{"avg_rating": 8.333333333333334, "count": 40, "id": 194, "name": "Time", "sort": 40}, {"avg_rating": 8.222222222222221, "count": 31, "id": 92, "name": "Biography", "sort": 31}, {"avg_rating": 10.0, "count": 5, "id": 331, "name": "Girls \u0026 Women", "sort": 5}, {"avg_rating": 10.0, "count": 2, "id": 119, "name": "Ethnic \u0026 Regional", "sort": 2}, {"avg_rating": 10.0, "count": 2, "id": 120, "name": "African American \u0026 Black", "sort": 2}, {"avg_rating": null, "count": 1, "id": 150, "name": "Cultural", "sort": 1}], "timestamp": "2022-10-05 15:54:08.709178+00:00", "title": "Aftershocks: A Memoir"}, {"author_ids": "126", "authors": [{"avg_rating": 10.0, "count": 1, "id": 126, "name": "Patrick Radden Keefe", "sort": "Keefe, Patrick Radden"}], "comments": "\u003cdiv\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNATIONAL BOOK CRITICS CIRCLE NOMINEE \u2022 A NEW YORK TIMES NOTABLE\u00a0BOOK OF THE YEAR \u2022 NEW YORK TIMES BEST SELLER \u2022 A grand, devastating portrait of three generations of the Sackler family, famed for their philanthropy, whose fortune was built by Valium and whose reputation was destroyed by OxyContin. From the prize-winning and bestselling author of Say Nothing The history of the Sackler dynasty is rife with drama\u2014baroque personal lives; bitter disputes over estates; fistfights in boardrooms; glittering art collections; Machiavellian courtroom maneuvers; and the calculated use of money to burnish reputations and crush the less powerful.\u00a0The Sackler name has adorned the walls of many storied institutions\u2014Harvard, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Oxford, the Louvre. They are one of the richest families in the world, known for their lavish donations to the arts and the sciences. The source of the family fortune was vague, however, until it emerged that the Sacklers were responsible for making and marketing a blockbuster painkiller that was the catalyst for the opioid crisis. Empire of Pain begins with the story of three doctor brothers, Raymond, Mortimer and the incalculably energetic Arthur, who weathered the poverty of the Great Depression and appalling anti-Semitism. Working at a barbaric mental institution, Arthur saw a better way and conducted groundbreaking research into drug treatments. He also had a genius for marketing, especially for pharmaceuticals, and bought a small ad firm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eArthur devised the marketing for Valium, and built the first great Sackler fortune. He purchased a drug manufacturer, Purdue Frederick, which would be run by Raymond and Mortimer. The brothers began collecting art, and wives, and grand residences in exotic locales. Their children and grandchildren grew up in luxury.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eForty years later, Raymond\u2019s son Richard ran the family-owned Purdue. The template Arthur Sackler created to sell Valium\u2014co-opting doctors, influencing the FDA, downplaying the drug\u2019s addictiveness\u2014was employed to launch a far more potent product: OxyContin. The drug went on to generate some thirty-five billion dollars in revenue, and to launch a public health crisis in which hundreds of thousands would die. This is the saga of three generations of a single family and the mark they would leave on the world, a tale that moves from the bustling streets of early twentieth-century Brooklyn to the seaside palaces\u00a0of Greenwich, Connecticut, and Cap d\u2019Antibes to the corridors of power in Washington, D.C.\u00a0 Empire of Pain chronicles the multiple investigations of the Sacklers and their company, and the scorched-earth legal tactics that the family has used to evade accountability.\u00a0Empire of Pain is a masterpiece of narrative reporting and writing, exhaustively documented and ferociously compelling. It is a portrait of the excesses of America\u2019s second Gilded Age, a study of impunity among the super elite and a relentless investigation of the naked greed and indifference to human suffering that built one of the world\u2019s great fortunes.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e", "custom_clean": 1, "custom_lists": [{"id": 5, "sort": "Must Read.2021 Time", "value": "Must Read.2021 Time"}], "custom_lists_ids": "5", "custom_read_date": null, "custom_reading_list": 0, "custom_types": [{"id": 1, "sort": "eBook", "value": "eBook"}], "custom_types_ids": "1", "flags": 1, "has_cover": 1, "id": 124, "identifier_ids": "408,406,407", "identifiers": [{"book": 124, "id": 407, "name": "ISBN", "path": "https://www.worldcat.org/isbn/9780385545693", "sort": "isbn", "type": "isbn", "val": "9780385545693"}, {"book": 124, "id": 406, "name": "Google Books", "path": "https://books.google.com/books?id=Qb4IEAAAQBAJ", "sort": "google", "type": "google", "val": "Qb4IEAAAQBAJ"}, {"book": 124, "id": 408, "name": "Goodreads", "path": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43868109", "sort": "goodreads", "type": "goodreads", "val": "43868109"}], "isbn": "9780385545693", "language_ids": "1", "languages": [{"avg_rating": 8.3717277486911, "count": 276, "id": 1, "name": "ENG", "sort": "ENG"}], "last_modified": "2023-05-04 17:55:52.136675+00:00", "order_by": "2022-10-05 15:54:07.602947+00:00", "path": "Patrick Radden Keefe/Empire of Pain_ The Secret History (124)", "pubdate": "2021-04-13", "publisher_ids": "82", "publishers": [{"avg_rating": 8.666666666666666, "count": 3, "id": 82, "name": "Knopf Publishing Group", "sort": "Knopf Publishing Group"}], "rating": 5, "series": [], "series_ids": null, "size": 5759595, "tag_ids": "51,57,58,60,92,194", "tags": [{"avg_rating": 8.333333333333334, "count": 40, "id": 194, "name": "Time", "sort": 40}, {"avg_rating": 8.222222222222221, "count": 31, "id": 92, "name": "Biography", "sort": 31}, {"avg_rating": 8.454545454545455, "count": 24, "id": 60, "name": "History", "sort": 24}, {"avg_rating": 8.347826086956522, "count": 23, "id": 57, "name": "Politics", "sort": 23}, {"avg_rating": 8.363636363636363, "count": 12, "id": 51, "name": "Business", "sort": 12}, {"avg_rating": 8.4, "count": 12, "id": 58, "name": "Science", "sort": 12}], "timestamp": "2022-10-05 15:54:07.602947+00:00", "title": "Empire of Pain: The Secret History of the Sackler Dynasty"}, {"author_ids": "124", "authors": [{"avg_rating": 8.0, "count": 1, "id": 124, "name": "Suzanne Simard", "sort": "Simard, Suzanne"}], "comments": "\u003cdiv\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuzanne Simard is a pioneer on the frontier of plant communication and intelligence; she\u0027s been compared to Rachel Carson, hailed as a scientist who conveys complex, technical ideas in a way that is dazzling and profound.

Childhood tells the story of a misfit child\u0027s single-minded determination to become a poet; Youth describes her early experiences of sex, work, and independence.

Ditlevsen\u0027s trilogy is remarkable for its intensity and its immersive depiction of a world of complex female friendships, family and growing up--in this sense, it\u0027s Copenhagen\u0027s answer to Elena Ferrante\u0027s Neapolitan Novels. She can also be seen as a spiritual forerunner of confessional writers like Karl Ove Knausgaard, Annie Ernaux, Rachel Cusk and Deborah Levy.

Results: Out of the 192 silk-related studies, 9 met the criteria.

Biomedical applications of cocoon silk derivatives span from tissue regeneration (n = 6) to energy harvesting (n = 4).

But Apple is now a victim of its own success, caught in the middle of a new Cold War between two superpowers. </p>\n<p>On the brink of bankruptcy in 1996, Apple made a strategic move to offshore its operations. By 2003 it was being lured to China by the promise of affordable labor that allowed the company to churn out premium products at an unprecedented scale. For years, the Silicon Valley giant sent thousands of America\u2019s top engineers to China and spent tens of billions of dollars on equipment, spurring the transformation of a cheap labor country into the world\u2019s most sophisticated electronics manufacturing powerhouse. Fast forward to 90% of iPhone assembly happens in China. Despite capturing less than 20% of the global smartphone market, Apple\u2019s operations allow it to rake in 80% of the sector\u2019s profits. </p>\n<p>Yet Beijing has tightened its grip, incentivizing Apple to work with more Chinese companies in its production, exerting control over what Chinese users can do on the iPhone, and requiring customer data for its citizens to be stored in state-backed data centers. The visionary company that Steve Jobs dreamed of finds itself in a tight spot. No other nation can match China\u2019s quality, volumes, and flexibility as a producer of nearly half a billion iGadgets yearly, and Apple isn\u2019t keen to abandon a market where it generates more profit than even China\u2019s own tech giants. </p>\n<p>Investigative journalist Patrick McGee draws on 200 interviews with former Apple executives and engineers to reveal how Cupertino\u2019s choice to anchor its supply chain in China has increasingly made it vulnerable to the regime\u2019s whims.

About the Technology Traditional web dev stacks use a different programming language in every layer, resulting in a complex mashup of code and frameworks. Together, the MongoDB database, the Express and AngularJS frameworks, and Node.js constitute the MEAN stack\u2014a powerful platform that uses only one language, top to JavaScript. Developers and businesses love it because it's scalable and cost-effective. End users love it because the apps created with it are fast and responsive. It's a win-win-win! About the Book Getting MEAN with Mongo, Express, Angular, and Node teaches you how to develop web applications using the MEAN stack. First, you'll create the skeleton of a static site in Express and Node, and then push it up to a live web server. Next, you'll add a MongoDB database and build an API before using Angular to handle data manipulation and application logic in the browser. Finally you'll add an authentication system to the application, using the whole stack. When you finish, you'll have all the skills you need to build a dynamic data-driven web application. What's Inside About the Reader Readers should have some web development experience. This book is based on MongoDB 2, Express 4, Angular 1, and Node.js 4.

As an engineer or developer, you need to confidently own each stage of the software delivery process. This book introduces a new paradigm, <em>BEAMOps,</em> that helps you build, test, deploy, and debug BEAM applications. Create effective development and deployment strategies; leverage continuous improvement pipelines; and ensure environment integrity. Combine operational orchestrators such as Docker Swarm with the distribution, fault tolerance, and scalability of the BEAM, to create robust and reliable applications. </p>\n<p>BEAMOps starts by building a solid foundation for your project. On the infrastructure side, see how to use Terraform before you even start coding to automate your deployment and operations. On the project management side, we show you how to use issues and milestones to simplify tracking; you\u2019ll use this foundation as you go through the book, implementing each of the steps required to deploy a scalable Elixir application.</p>\n<p>Now that you have a foundation, you can start building. Create a Phoenix LiveView application and explore mix releases. Make your deployments reliable with Docker. Continuously improve your codebase by implementing an efficient continuous deployment/integration pipeline with GitHub Actions. Scale the Phoenix LiveView application and operate a distributed BEAM system in production using AWS EC2 nodes, AWS load balancers, and a remote Docker swarm. Recognize which application metrics should be collected and monitored, and set alerts when certain thresholds are met to ensure that your application auto-scales. Ship less code more often, and ensure it works!</p>\n<p>The pragmatic BEAMOps approach that we teach in this book\u2014an extension of the well-known DevOps paradigm\u2014will help you become a multidisciplinary developer who is empowered to own each stage of the software delivery process. After reading this book, you\u2019ll understand how to apply the BEAMOps principles in your daily work, creating reliable, scalable, and easy to understand applications in a cooperative team environment.</p></div>", "isbn": null, "path": "Ellie Fairholm, Josep Giralt D'Laco/Engineering Elixir Applications (644)", "has_cover": 1, "flags": 1, "author_ids": ["646"], "series_ids": null, "publisher_ids": ["275"], "language_ids": ["1"], "tag_ids": ["190", "191", "511"], "identifier_ids": null, "order_by": "2025-05-24 19:59:44.506459+00:00", "authors": [{"id": 646, "name": "Ellie Fairholm| Josep Giralt D\u2019Lacoste", "count": 1, "avg_rating": null, "sort": "Ellie Fairholm, Josep Giralt D\u2019Lacoste"}], "publishers": [{"id": 275, "name": "The Pragmatic Bookshelf, LLC", "count": 7, "avg_rating": null, "sort": "The Pragmatic Bookshelf, LLC"}], "languages": [{"id": 1, "name": "ENG", "count": 448, "avg_rating": 8.366795366795367, "sort": "ENG"}], "tags": [{"id": 190, "name": "Programming", "count": 54, "avg_rating": 7.857142857142857, "sort": 54}, {"id": 191, "name": "Computer Science", "count": 51, "avg_rating": 8.0, "sort": 51}, {"id": 511, "name": "Elixir", "count": 17, "avg_rating": 9.0, "sort": 17}], "custom_types": "eBook", "custom_reading_list": 0, "custom_read_date": null, "custom_lists": [{"id": 18, "value": "Programming.Elixir", "sort": "Programming.Elixir"}], "custom_lists_ids": ["18"], "custom_clean": 1}, {"id": 643, "title": "Elixir in Action, Third Edition", "rating": null, "timestamp": "2025-05-24 19:59:44.391794+00:00", "pubdate": "2024-03-19", "last_modified": "2025-05-29 14:22:59.457405+00:00", "size": 1458908, "comments": "<div>\n<p>Elixir in Action, Third Edition teaches you how to create distributed applications and server-side systems using Elixir and the Erlang VM.

This dual-language edition features one third of Nietzsche's work, keeping the most famous concepts intact and encompassing a variety of moods and modes as well as the author's full linguistic scope. </p>\n<p>These selections reflect the most important philosophic concepts in the book, such as the \"death of God\" (i.e., the bankruptcy of the traditional Christian morality), with the subsequent need for a new morality administered by a more evolved humanity (the \u00dcbermensch), and the \"will to power. </p>\n<p>\" Editor Stanley Appelbaum presents accurate English translations on the pages facing the original German, an informative introduction to the author's life and oeuvre, plus notes throughout the text and brief summaries of the omitted chapters. </p>\n<p>Nietzsche's influence on twentieth-century thought is incalculable. Freud is reputed to have developed his theory of the ego from some passages in Zarathustra. The Surrealists and Existentialists admired Nietzsche, and his skepticism made him a model for Postmodernist thinkers. This volume represents an outstanding resource not only for students and teachers of German language and literature but also for anyone with an interest in literature, philosophy, and psychology.</p></div>", "isbn": "9780486120621", "path": "Friedrich Nietzsche/Thus Spoke Zarathustra (Selections) (610)", "has_cover": 1, "flags": 1, "author_ids": ["625"], "series_ids": null,

Losing means certain death. The Hunger Games have begun. . . . In the ruins of a place once known as North America lies the nation of Panem, a shining Capitol surrounded by twelve outlying districts. The Capitol is harsh and cruel and keeps the districts in line by forcing them all to send one boy and one girl between the ages of twelve and eighteen to participate in the annual Hunger Games, a fight to the death on live TV. Sixteen-year-old Katniss Everdeen regards it as a death sentence when she steps forward to take her sister's place in the Games. But Katniss has been close to dead before-and survival, for her, is second nature. Without really meaning to, she becomes a contender. But if she is to win, she will have to start making choices that weigh survival against humanity and life against love.</p></div>", "isbn": "9780439023481", "path": "Suzanne Collins/The Hunger Games (587)", "has_cover": 1, "flags": 1, "author_ids": ["601"], "series_ids": ["33"], "publisher_ids": ["260"], "language_ids": ["1"], "tag_ids": ["4", "18", "45", "75", "76", "84", "88", "130", "437", "445", "480", "481", "482", "483", "484", "485", "486", "487", "488"], "identifier_ids": ["1626", "1624", "1625"], "order_by": "2024-03-27 03:41:05.148914+00:00", "authors": [{"id": 601, "name": "Suzanne Collins", "count": 4, "avg_rating": 9.333333333333334, "sort": "Collins, Suzanne"}], "series": [{"id": 33, "name": "The Hunger Games", "count": 4, "avg_rating": 9.333333333333334, "sort": "The Hunger Games"}], "publishers": [{"id": 260, "name": "Scholastic, Inc.", "count": 4, "avg_rating": 9.333333333333334, "sort": "Scholastic, Inc."}], "languages": [{"id": 1, "name": "ENG", "count": 448, "avg_rating": 8.366795366795367, "sort": "ENG"}], "tags": [{"id": 76, "name": "Fantasy", "count": 146, "avg_rating": 8.772727272727273, "sort": 146}, {"id": 4, "name": "Fiction", "count": 113, "avg_rating": 9.083333333333334, "sort": 113}, {"id": 75, "name": "Science Fiction", "count": 110, "avg_rating": 8.74074074074074, "sort": 110}, {"id": 84, "name": "Adventure", "count": 85, "avg_rating": 9.08, "sort": 85}, {"id": 130, "name": "Action", "count": 54, "avg_rating": 9.416666666666666, "sort": 54}, {"id": 88, "name": "Young Adult", "count": 28, "avg_rating": 8.571428571428571, "sort": 28}, {"id": 18, "name": "Romance", "count": 25, "avg_rating": 9.0, "sort": 25}, {"id": 437, "name": "Juvenile Fiction", "count": 15, "avg_rating": 9.142857142857142, "sort": 15}, {"id": 445, "name": "Fantasy & Magic", "count": 11, "avg_rating": 9.0, "sort": 11}, {"id": 45, "name": "Performing Arts", "count": 9, "avg_rating": 8.666666666666666, "sort": 9}, {"id": 482, "name": "Interpersonal Relations", "count": 5, "avg_rating": 9.0, "sort": 5}, {"id": 483, "name": "Insurgency", "count": 4, "avg_rating": 9.333333333333334, "sort": 4}, {"id": 484, "name": "Survival Stories", "count": 4, "avg_rating": 9.333333333333334, "sort": 4}, {"id": 480, "name": "Television programs", "count": 3, "avg_rating": 9.0, "sort": 3}, {"id": 481, "name": "Survival", "count": 3, "avg_rating": 9.0, "sort": 3}, {"id": 485, "name": "Social Issues", "count": 3, "avg_rating": 9.0, "sort": 3}, {"id": 486, "name": "Television & Radio", "count": 3, "avg_rating": 9.0, "sort": 3}, {"id": 487, "name": "Survival skills", "count": 3, "avg_rating": 9.0, "sort": 3}, {"id": 488, "name": "Contests", "count": 3, "avg_rating": 9.0, "sort": 3}], "identifiers": [{"id": 1625, "book": 587, "type": "isbn", "val": "9780439023481", "sort": "isbn", "name": "ISBN", "path": "https://www.worldcat.org/isbn/9780439023481"}, {"id": 1624, "book": 587, "type": "barnesnoble", "val": "1100171585", "sort": "barnesnoble", "name": "Barnes & Noble", "path": "https://www.barnesandnoble.com/1100171585"}, {"id": 1626, "book": 587, "type": "amazon", "val": "0439023483", "sort": "amazon", "name": "Amazon", "path": "https://amazon.com/dp/0439023483"}], "custom_types": "eBook", "custom_reading_list": 0, "custom_read_date": null, "custom_lists": [], "custom_lists_ids": null, "custom_clean": 1}, {"id": 586, "title": "The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes", "rating": null, "timestamp": "2024-03-27 03:40:54.280777+00:00", "pubdate": "2023-08-01", "last_modified": "2025-05-29 14:22:59.457405+00:00", "size": 2984414, "comments": "<div>\n<p style=\"font-weight: bold\">Ambition will fuel him.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: bold\">Competition will drive him.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: bold\">But power has its price.</p>\n<p>It is the morning of the reaping that will kick off the tenth annual Hunger Games.

Along the way, it offers valuable insights that reflect the current market environment: reexamining prepayment behavior and analysis to describe the latest thinking on prepayment speeds and behavior, while taking into account credit and housing-related factors; and devoting an entirely new chapter to the evaluation of non-agency MBS. </p>\n<p>Divided into four comprehensive parts, this reliable resource contains cutting-edge concepts you'll need to understand in order to succeed within this arena. </p>\n<p><strong>Part One:</strong> introduces the essential aspects of the mortgage and MBS markets </p>\n<p><strong>Part Two:</strong> discusses prepayment and default behavior, along with an array of metrics and conventions used to quantify these activities </p>\n<p><strong>Part Three:</strong> describes a variety of structures and tranches, along with techniques used in structuring them </p>\n<p><strong>Part Four:</strong> outlines the metrics and methodologies necessary to evaluate the potential risks and returns associated with mortgage-backed securities </p>\n<p>The mortgage and MBS markets remain in a highly unsettled state, which makes a broad and sophisticated understanding of MBS markets and products essential. The <em>Second Edition</em> of <em>Mortgage-Backed Securities</em> offers you a realistic assessment of this field and will put you in a better position to excel in one of the most dynamic and challenging areas of finance.</p></div>", "isbn": "9781118149294", "path": "Frank J.

Divided into four parts, this book addresses a variety of important topics, including mortgage credit (non-agency, first and second lien), mortgage securitizations (alternate structures and subprime triggers), credit default swaps on mortgage securities (ABX, cash synthetic relationships, CDO credit default swaps), and much more. In addition, the authors outline the origins of the subprime crisis, showing how during the 2004-2006 period, as housing became less affordable, origination standards were stretched-and when home price appreciation then turned to home price depreciation, defaults and delinquencies rose across the board. The recent growth in subprime lending, along with a number of other industry factors, has made the demand for timely knowledge and solutions greater than ever before, and this guide contains the information financial professionals need to succeed in this challenging field.</p></div>", "isbn": "9780470392744", "path": "Laurie S.

Told through fascinating stories, informed by cutting-edge research and illustratedwith amazing insights from Adam Grant's conversations with people such as Elon Musk, Hilary Clinton's campaign team, top CEOs and leading scientists, this is the ultimate guide to keeping your thinking fresh, learning when to question your ideas and update your own opinions, and how to inspire those around you to do the same.</p></div>", "isbn": "9780753553916", "path": "Adam Grant/Think Again (575)", "has_cover": 1, "flags": 1, "author_ids": ["579"], "series_ids": null, "publisher_ids": ["251"], "language_ids": ["1"], "tag_ids": null, "identifier_ids": ["1576"], "order_by": "2024-02-23 02:02:13.021966+00:00", "authors": [{"id": 579, "name": "Adam Grant", "count": 1, "avg_rating": null, "sort": "Grant, Adam"}], "publishers": [{"id": 251, "name": "WH Allen", "count": 1, "avg_rating": null, "sort": "WH Allen"}], "languages": [{"id": 1, "name": "ENG", "count": 448, "avg_rating": 8.366795366795367, "sort": "ENG"}], "identifiers": [{"id": 1576, "book": 575, "type": "isbn", "val": "9780753553916", "sort": "isbn", "name": "ISBN", "path": "https://www.worldcat.org/isbn/9780753553916"}], "custom_types": "eBook", "custom_reading_list": 1, "custom_read_date": null, "custom_lists": [], "custom_lists_ids": null, "custom_clean": 1}, {"id": 574, "title": "The Confidence Game", "rating": null, "timestamp": "2024-02-23 02:02:12.515825+00:00", "pubdate": "2016-01-28", "last_modified": "2025-05-29 14:22:59.457405+00:00", "size": 571912, "comments": "<div>\n<p>The con artist: from Bernie Madoff to Clark Rockefeller to Lance Armstrong.

Anti-aliasing has previously been addressed by mip-NeRF 360, which reasons about sub-volumes along a cone rather than points along a ray, but this approach is not natively compatible with current grid-based techniques. We show how ideas from rendering and signal processing can be used to construct a technique that combines mip-NeRF 360 and grid-based models such as Instant NGP to yield error rates that are 8% - 77% lower than either prior technique, and that trains 24x faster than mip-NeRF 360.</p></div>", "isbn": null, "path": "Jonathan T.

Prior approaches build on NeRF and rely on implicit representations. This is slow since it requires many MLP evaluations, constraining real-world applications. We show that dynamic 3D scenes can be explicitly represented by six planes of learned features, leading to an elegant solution we call HexPlane. A HexPlane computes features for points in spacetime by fusing vectors extracted from each plane, which is highly efficient. Pairing a HexPlane with a tiny MLP to regress output colors and training via volume rendering gives impressive results for novel view synthesis on dynamic scenes, matching the image quality of prior work but reducing training time by more than 100x. Extensive ablations confirm our HexPlane design and show that it is robust to different feature fusion mechanisms, coordinate systems, and decoding mechanisms.

But beware of excessive choice: choice overload can make you question the decisions you make before you even make them, it can set you up for unrealistically high expectations, and it can make you blame yourself for any and all failures. In the long run, this can lead to decision-making paralysis, anxiety, and perpetual stress. And, in a culture that tells us that there is no excuse for falling short of perfection when your options are limitless, too much choice can lead to clinical depression. </p>\n<p>In The Paradox of Choice, Barry Schwartz explains at what point choice\u2014the hallmark of individual freedom and self-determination that we so cherish\u2014becomes detrimental to our psychological and emotional well-being. In accessible, engaging, and anecdotal prose, Schwartz shows how the dramatic explosion in choice\u2014from the mundane to the profound challenges of balancing career, family, and individual needs\u2014has paradoxically become a problem instead of a solution. Schwartz also shows how our obsession with choice encourages us to seek that which makes us feel worse. </p>\n<p>By synthesizing current research in the social sciences, Schwartz makes the counter intuitive case that eliminating choices can greatly reduce the stress, anxiety, and busyness of our lives. He offers eleven practical steps on how to limit choices to a manageable number, have the discipline to focus on those that are important and ignore the rest, and ultimately derive greater satisfaction from the choices you have to make. <br></p></div>", "isbn": "9780061748998", "path": "Barry Schwartz/The Paradox of Choice (564)", "has_cover": 1, "flags": 1, "author_ids": ["555"], "series_ids": null, "publisher_ids": ["244"], "language_ids": ["1"], "tag_ids": ["31", "43", "51", "58", "59", "62"], "identifier_ids": ["1557", "1560", "1558", "1556", "1559"], "order_by": "2023-08-14 17:10:01.478945+00:00", "authors": [{"id": 555, "name": "Barry Schwartz", "count": 1, "avg_rating": 8.0, "sort": "Schwartz, Barry"}], "publishers": [{"id": 244, "name": "Harper Collins", "count": 48, "avg_rating": 9.28125, "sort": "Harper Collins"}], "languages": [{"id": 1, "name": "ENG", "count": 448, "avg_rating": 8.366795366795367, "sort": "ENG"}], "tags": [{"id": 43, "name": "Self Help", "count": 37, "avg_rating": 8.0625, "sort": 37}, {"id": 31, "name": "Psychology", "count": 30, "avg_rating": 8.076923076923077, "sort": 30}, {"id": 51, "name": "Business", "count": 23, "avg_rating": 8.272727272727273, "sort": 23}, {"id": 58, "name": "Science", "count": 19, "avg_rating": 8.125, "sort": 19}, {"id": 62, "name": "Philosophy", "count": 18, "avg_rating": 7.888888888888889, "sort": 18}, {"id": 59, "name": "Sociology", "count": 7, "avg_rating": 8.857142857142858, "sort": 7}], "identifiers": [{"id": 1559, "book": 564, "type": "isbn", "val": "9780061748998", "sort": "isbn", "name": "ISBN", "path": "https://www.worldcat.org/isbn/9780061748998"}, {"id": 1556, "book": 564, "type": "google", "val": "g422yyua-P8C", "sort": "google", "name": "Google Books", "path": "https://books.google.com/books?id=g422yyua-P8C"}, {"id": 1558, "book": 564, "type": "goodreads", "val": "10130401", "sort": "goodreads", "name": "Goodreads", "path": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10130401"}, {"id": 1560, "book": 564, "type": "barnesnoble", "val": "1100609414", "sort": "barnesnoble", "name": "Barnes & Noble", "path": "https://www.barnesandnoble.com/1100609414"}, {"id": 1557, "book": 564, "type": "amazon", "val": "0061748994", "sort": "amazon", "name": "Amazon", "path": "https://amazon.com/dp/0061748994"}], "custom_types": "eBook", "custom_reading_list": 1, "custom_read_date": null, "custom_lists": [], "custom_lists_ids": null, "custom_clean": 1}, {"id": 560, "title": "Thinking, Fast and Slow", "rating": null, "timestamp": "2023-08-14 17:09:56.365446+00:00", "pubdate": "2011-10-25", "last_modified": "2025-05-29 14:22:59.457405+00:00", "size": 3675247, "comments": "<div>\n<p><strong>In his mega bestseller,</strong> Thinking, Fast and Slow <strong>, Daniel Kahneman, the renowned psychologist and winner of the Nobel Prize in Economics, takes us on a groundbreaking tour of the mind and explains the two systems that drive the way we think.</strong> </p>\n<p>System 1 is fast, intuitive, and emotional; System 2 is slower, more deliberative, and more logical.

Between 1942 and 1945 Frankl labored in four different camps, including Auschwitz, while his parents, brother, and pregnant wife perished. Based on his own experience and the experiences of others he treated later in his practice, Frankl argues that we cannot avoid suffering but we can choose how to cope with it, find meaning in it, and move forward with renewed purpose. Frankl's theory-known as logotherapy, from the Greek word logos (\"meaning\")-holds that our primary drive in life is not pleasure, as Freud maintained, but the discovery and pursuit of what we personally find meaningful.<br><br>At the time of Frankl's death in 1997, Man's Search for Meaning had sold more than 10 million copies in twenty-four languages.

The majority of people associate Unreal Engine with 3D games. However, it may also be used to create 2D games with ease. It is the de facto standard in the world of game development. That said, it is not hard to be confused when getting started with Unreal Engine because of the wide range of features that it provides.</p>\n<p>Mastering Unreal Engine will teach you exactly where to begin. You will learn how to download Unreal Engine, construct your first game, start your game, receive an introduction to blueprints, and ultimately, develop a workable framework.</p>\n<p>Unreal Engine is a robust game development engine that offers a wide range of features for creating 2D and 3D games on various platforms. Unreal Engine technology powers hundreds of games, and thousands of people have created careers and businesses on the skills they learned while working with this engine.</p>\n<p>To help you get the most out of this powerful piece of technology, Mastering Unreal Engine begins with simple game ideas and playable projects that you can complete at your own pace. The book starts by covering the foundations of using Unreal Engine to build a simple game level. You will also learn how to add such details to the game as actors, animation, and effects.</p>\n<p>Mastering Unreal Engine talks at length about the various features of the Unreal Engine game engine, how to install it and how to construct a project in C++, and good coding practices for game development. Furthermore, the book also covers certain niche areas, such as how to utilize Visual Studio in gaming, and how to use existing predefined blueprints to grow and foster a game.

Coding with Kotlin means less hassle. The Kotlin programming language offers an expressive syntax, a strong intuitive type system, and great tooling support along with seamless interoperability with existing Java code, libraries, and frameworks. Kotlin can be compiled to Java bytecode, so you can use it everywhere Java is used, including Android. And with an effi cient compiler and a small standard library, Kotlin imposes virtually no runtime overhead.</p>\n<p>About the Book</p>\n<p>Kotlin in Action teaches you to use the Kotlin language for production-quality applications. Written for experienced Java developers, this example-rich book goes further than most language books, covering interesting topics like building DSLs with natural language syntax.

We bridge literature that is diverse in both content moderation subject matter, such as malware, spam, hate speech, terrorist content, and enterprise policy compliance, as well as intended deployments, including not only privacy-preserving content moderation for messaging, email, and cloud storage, but also private introspection of encrypted web traffic by middleboxes. In this work, we systematize the study of content moderation in E2EE settings. We set out a process pipeline for content moderation, drawing on a broad interdisciplinary literature that is not specific to E2EE.

Upgrade your web API to GraphQL, leveraging its flexible queries to empower your users, and its declarative structure to simplify your code. Absinthe is the GraphQL toolkit for Elixir, a functional programming language designed to enable massive concurrency atop robust application architectures. Written by the creators of Absinthe, this book will help you take full advantage of these two groundbreaking technologies. Build your own flexible, high-performance APIs using step-by-step guidance and expert advice you won't find anywhere else. GraphQL is a new way of structuring and building web services, and the result is transformational. Find out how to offer a more tailored, cohesive experience to your users, easily aggregate data from different data sources, and improve your back end's maintainability with Absinthe's declarative approach to defining how your API works. Build a GraphQL-based API from scratch using Absinthe, starting from core principles. Learn the type system and how to expand your schema to suit your application's needs. Discover a growing ecosystem of tools and utilities to understand, debug, and document your API. Take it to production, but do it safely with solid best practices in mind. Find out how complexity analysis and persisted queries can let you support your users flexibly, but responsibly too. Along the way, discover how Elixir makes all the difference for a high performance, fault-tolerant API. Use asynchronous and batching execution, or write your own custom add-ons to extend Absinthe. Go live with subscriptions, delivering data over websockets on top of Elixir (and Erlang/OTP's) famous solid performance and real-time capabilities. Transform your applications with the powerful combination of Elixir and GraphQL, using Absinthe. What You Need: To follow along with the book, you should have Erlang/OTP 19+ and Elixir 1.4+ installed. The book will guide you through setting up a new Phoenix application using Absinthe.</p></div>", "isbn": "9781680505931", "path": "Bruce Williams, Ben Wilson/Craft GraphQL APIs in Elixir With A (334)", "has_cover": 1, "flags": 1, "author_ids": ["655"], "series_ids": null, "publisher_ids": ["8"], "language_ids": ["1"], "tag_ids": ["190", "230", "339", "341", "342", "343", "344", "345", "346", "347", "348"], "identifier_ids": ["1112", "1111"], "order_by": "2023-05-23 12:42:14.800637+00:00", "authors": [{"id": 655, "name": "Bruce Williams| Ben Wilson", "count": 1, "avg_rating": null, "sort": "Bruce Williams, Ben Wilson"}], "publishers": [{"id": 8, "name": "Pragmatic Bookshelf", "count": 10, "avg_rating": 8.5, "sort": "Pragmatic Bookshelf"}], "languages": [{"id": 1, "name": "ENG", "count": 448, "avg_rating": 8.366795366795367, "sort": "ENG"}], "tags": [{"id": 190, "name": "Programming", "count": 54, "avg_rating": 7.857142857142857, "sort": 54}, {"id": 339, "name": "Computers", "count": 22, "avg_rating": 7.625, "sort": 22}, {"id": 348, "name": "Languages", "count": 14, "avg_rating": 8.666666666666666, "sort": 14}, {"id": 342, "name": "Web Programming", "count": 6, "avg_rating": 8.0, "sort": 6}, {"id": 230, "name": "Open Source", "count": 5, "avg_rating": 8.5, "sort": 5}, {"id": 341, "name": "Internet", "count": 3, "avg_rating": 8.0, "sort": 3}, {"id": 344, "name": "Data Science", "count": 3, "avg_rating": 8.0, "sort": 3}, {"id": 343, "name": "Web Services & APIs", "count": 2, "avg_rating": 8.0, "sort": 2}, {"id": 346, "name": "Distributed Systems", "count": 2, "avg_rating": null, "sort": 2}, {"id": 347, "name": "Client-Server Computing", "count": 2, "avg_rating": null, "sort": 2}, {"id": 345, "name": "Data Modeling & Design", "count": 1, "avg_rating": null, "sort": 1}], "identifiers": [{"id": 1111, "book": 334, "type": "isbn", "val": "9781680505931", "sort": "isbn", "name": "ISBN", "path": "https://www.worldcat.org/isbn/9781680505931"}, {"id": 1112, "book": 334, "type": "google", "val": "IitZDwAAQBAJ", "sort": "google", "name": "Google Books", "path": "https://books.google.com/books?id=IitZDwAAQBAJ"}], "custom_types": "eBook", "custom_reading_list": 1, "custom_read_date": null, "custom_lists": [{"id": 18, "value": "Programming.Elixir", "sort": "Programming.Elixir"}, {"id": 19, "value": "Programming.GraphQL", "sort": "Programming.GraphQL"}], "custom_lists_ids": ["18", "19"], "custom_clean": 1}, {"id": 332, "title": "The Science of Discworld II: The Globe", "rating": 4, "timestamp": "2023-05-02 21:12:03.948771+00:00", "pubdate": "2002-01-01", "last_modified": "2025-05-29 14:22:59.457405+00:00", "size": 528675, "comments": "<div>\n<p>The acclaimed Science of Discworld centred around an original Pratchett story about the Wizards of Discworld.

Sigmund Freud is an Austrian neurologist and the founding father of psychoanalysis, a method for treating mental illness and also a theory that explains human behavior. Freud believed that events in our childhood hold a great impact on our adult lives, shaping our personality. In creating psychoanalysis, Freud designed therapeutic techniques such as the use of free association and discovered transference, establishing its central role in the analytic process. Freud saw that man is at war with himself and often unable to tolerate too much reality. He propounded the theory that dreams are the contraband representations of the beast within man, smuggled into awareness during sleep. In Freudian interpretation, the analysis of dreams is the key to unlocking the secrets of the unconscious mind.</p></div>", "isbn": "9789354992926", "path": "Sigmund Freud/The Interpretation of Dreams (275)", "has_cover": 1, "flags": 1, "author_ids": ["365"], "series_ids": null, "publisher_ids": ["176"], "language_ids": ["1"], "tag_ids": ["31", "214", "271", "272"], "identifier_ids": ["926", "924", "925"], "order_by": "2023-03-16 22:04:27.128124+00:00", "authors": [{"id": 365, "name": "Sigmund Freud", "count": 1, "avg_rating": null, "sort": "Freud, Sigmund"}], "publishers": [{"id": 176, "name": "General Press", "count": 1, "avg_rating": null, "sort": "General Press"}], "languages": [{"id": 1, "name": "ENG", "count": 448, "avg_rating": 8.366795366795367, "sort": "ENG"}], "tags": [{"id": 31, "name": "Psychology", "count": 30, "avg_rating": 8.076923076923077, "sort": 30}, {"id": 214, "name": "Gutenberg", "count": 14, "avg_rating": 7.666666666666667, "sort": 14}, {"id": 271, "name": "Dream interpretation", "count": 1, "avg_rating": null, "sort": 1}, {"id": 272, "name": "Psychoanalysis", "count": 1, "avg_rating": null, "sort": 1}], "identifiers": [{"id": 925, "book": 275, "type": "isbn", "val": "9789354992926", "sort": "isbn", "name": "ISBN", "path": "https://www.worldcat.org/isbn/9789354992926"}, {"id": 924, "book": 275, "type": "gutenberg", "val": "66048", "sort": "gutenberg", "name": "Gutenberg", "path": "http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/66048"}, {"id": 926, "book": 275, "type": "google", "val": "VeI6zwEACAAJ", "sort": "google", "name": "Google Books", "path": "https://books.google.com/books?id=VeI6zwEACAAJ"}], "custom_types": "eBook", "custom_reading_list": 0, "custom_read_date": null, "custom_lists": [{"id": 7, "value": "Gutenberg Collection", "sort": "Gutenberg Collection"}], "custom_lists_ids": ["7"], "custom_clean": 1}, {"id": 274, "title": "Normale mensen", "rating": null, "timestamp": "2023-03-16 22:03:42.150380+00:00", "pubdate": "2019-01-14", "last_modified": "2025-05-29 14:22:59.457405+00:00", "size": 1124853, "comments": "<div>\n<p>Normale mensen van Sally Rooney is een intense liefdesgeschiedenis over de diepgaande invloed die geliefden op elkaars leven hebben \u2013 en het groeiende besef daarvan naarmate de jaren verstrijken.

Een intense roman die je je eigen liefdes laat herbeleven. \u2018Het is vooral in de bespiegelingen van beide hoofdpersonen dat Rooney haar verbijsterende meesterschap toont.\u2019 \u2013 de Volkskrant \u2018Opnieuw schittert deze zelfverzekerde Ierse schrijver met een kalme roman waarin een onderhuids drama schuilt. \u2013 NRC Handelsblad \u2018In bedrieglijk vanzelfsprekend proza dat zijn technisch vernuft soms welhaast verlegen lijkt te willen verbergen, tekent Rooney de eerste jongeren die weten dat ze het slechter zullen hebben dan hun ouders als een groep die zich, met het eigen gevoelsleven als enige houvast, een weg moet zoeken in een wereld die ideologisch en economisch op losse schroeven staat.\u2019 \u2013 Humo \u2018Meer! denk je, als het uit is. Nog meer! Niet stoppen!\u2019 \u2013 De Groene Amsterdammer \u2018En schrijven kan Rooney. Haar lezen is een ongemeen spannende ervaring. Rooney\u2019s originaliteit schuilt in haar sensitiviteit en inzicht. Ze floreert in dialogen waarin mensen nooit precies onder woorden brengen wat ze bedoelen en in het commentaar dat die wankele inborst subtiel openbaart.\u2019 \u2013 Trouw Tip DWDD Boekenpanel!</p></div>", "isbn": "9789026343452", "path": "Sally Rooney/Normale mensen (274)", "has_cover": 1, "flags": 1, "author_ids": ["364"], "series_ids": null, "publisher_ids": ["175"], "language_ids": ["2"], "tag_ids": ["4", "20", "151", "152", "331"], "identifier_ids": ["922", "923"], "order_by": "2023-03-16 22:03:42.150380+00:00", "authors": [{"id": 364, "name": "Sally Rooney", "count": 2, "avg_rating": null, "sort": "Rooney, Sally"}], "publishers": [{"id": 175, "name": "Ambo/Anthos B.V.", "count": 1, "avg_rating": null, "sort": "Ambo/Anthos B.V."}], "languages": [{"id": 2, "name": "NLD", "count": 62, "avg_rating": 8.0, "sort": "NLD"}], "tags": [{"id": 4, "name": "Fiction", "count": 113, "avg_rating": 9.083333333333334, "sort": 113}, {"id": 152, "name": "Literary", "count": 11, "avg_rating": 9.0, "sort": 11}, {"id": 151, "name": "Coming of Age", "count": 5, "avg_rating": 10.0, "sort": 5}, {"id": 331, "name": "Girls & Women", "count": 5, "avg_rating": 10.0, "sort": 5}, {"id": 20, "name": "Psychological", "count": 2, "avg_rating": 8.0, "sort": 2}], "identifiers": [{"id": 923, "book": 274, "type": "isbn", "val": "9789026343452", "sort": "isbn", "name": "ISBN", "path": "https://www.worldcat.org/isbn/9789026343452"}, {"id": 922, "book": 274, "type": "google", "val": "MfSADwAAQBAJ", "sort": "google", "name": "Google Books", "path": "https://books.google.com/books?id=MfSADwAAQBAJ"}], "custom_types": "eBook", "custom_reading_list": 0, "custom_read_date": "2024-04-09", "custom_lists": [], "custom_lists_ids": null, "custom_clean": 1}, {"id": 272, "title": "Normal People", "rating": null, "timestamp": "2023-03-16 22:01:46.243166+00:00", "pubdate": "2018-08-28", "last_modified": "2025-05-29 14:22:59.457405+00:00", "size": 1368074, "comments": "<div>\n<p>Normal People is a story of mutual fascination, friendship and love.

This essential guide begins with the fundamentals of wine in easy-to-absorb hits of information and pragmatic, everyday tips\u2014key varietals and winemaking regions, how to taste, when to save and when to splurge, and how to set up a wine tasting at home.

We learn the unvarnished truth, often for the first time, about some of the most iconic triumphs and infamous disasters in Valley history, from the comedy of errors at the birth of Apple to the avalanche of venture money that fostered hubris at WeWork and Uber.\u00a0 VCs\u2019 relentless search for grand slams brews an obsession with the ideal of the lone entrepreneur-genius, and companies seen as potential \u201cunicorns\u201d are given intoxicating amounts of power, with sometimes disastrous results. On a more systemic level, the need to make outsized bets on unproven talent reinforces bias, with women and minorities still represented at woefully low levels. This does not just have social justice implications: as Mallaby relates, China\u2019s homegrown VC sector, having learned at the Valley\u2019s feet, is exploding and now has more women VC luminaries than America has ever had. Still, Silicon Valley VC remains the top incubator of business innovation anywhere\u2014it is not where ideas come from so much as where they go to become the products and companies that create the future. By taking us so deeply into the VCs\u2019 game, The Power Law helps us think about our own future through their eyes.</p></div>", "isbn": "9780525560005", "path": "Sebastian Mallaby/The Power Law_ Venture Capital and (257)", "has_cover": 1, "flags": 1, "author_ids": ["334"], "series_ids": null, "publisher_ids": ["90"], "language_ids": ["1"], "tag_ids": ["11", "191", "245", "246"], "identifier_ids": ["879", "880"], "order_by": "2023-01-27 19:15:58.396903+00:00", "authors": [{"id": 334, "name": "Sebastian Mallaby", "count": 1, "avg_rating": null, "sort": "Mallaby, Sebastian"}], "publishers": [{"id": 90, "name": "Penguin Random House", "count": 21, "avg_rating": 8.75, "sort": "Penguin Random House"}], "languages": [{"id": 1, "name": "ENG", "count": 448, "avg_rating": 8.366795366795367, "sort": "ENG"}], "tags": [{"id": 191, "name": "Computer Science", "count": 51, "avg_rating": 8.0, "sort": 51}, {"id": 11, "name": "Business & Economics", "count": 22, "avg_rating": 8.133333333333333, "sort": 22}, {"id": 245, "name": "Corporate Finance", "count": 3, "avg_rating": 10.0, "sort": 3}, {"id": 246, "name": "Venture Capital", "count": 2, "avg_rating": 10.0, "sort": 2}], "identifiers": [{"id": 880, "book": 257, "type": "isbn", "val": "9780525560005", "sort": "isbn", "name": "ISBN", "path": "https://www.worldcat.org/isbn/9780525560005"}, {"id": 879, "book": 257, "type": "google", "val": "a3YsEAAAQBAJ", "sort": "google", "name": "Google Books", "path": "https://books.google.com/books?id=a3YsEAAAQBAJ"}], "custom_types": "eBook", "custom_reading_list": 1, "custom_read_date": null, "custom_lists": [], "custom_lists_ids": null, "custom_clean": 1}, {"id": 256, "title": "Waking Up: A Guide to Spirituality Without Religion", "rating": 4, "timestamp": "2023-01-27 19:15:57.141259+00:00", "pubdate": "2014-01-01", "last_modified": "2025-05-29 14:22:59.457405+00:00", "size": 2247689, "comments": "<div>\n<p>Product Description</p>\n<p>For the millions of Americans who want spirituality without religion, Sam Harris\u2019s latest New York Times bestseller is a guide to meditation as a rational practice informed by neuroscience and psychology.</p>\n<p>From Sam Harris, neuroscientist and author of numerous New York Times bestselling books, Waking Up is for the twenty percent of Americans who follow no religion but who suspect that important truths can be found in the experiences of such figures as Jesus, the Buddha, Lao Tzu, Rumi, and the other saints and sages of history.

An acronym for \"Phenethylamines I Have Known and Loved\", the book spans autobiography, organic chemistry, politics, ethnobotany, and psychopharmacology, and the cultural impact is likely to be profound for decades to come, as it has already. PiHKAL is divided into two parts, the first of which is a fictionalized autobiographical 'novel' - the main fiction is that it is fiction. This first half of the book is The Love Story, about two people named Shura and Alice who fall in love, though one of them is already in love with someone else. This love triangle is a painful ordeal they must go through, and that process unfolds before the reader with grace and great insight into human nature. Shura is a brilliant chemist who has dedicated his career to making psychoactive drugs, in the story they go through many experiences with the psychedelic compounds that Shura has discovered and has made in his lab, all of which have been bioassayed himself. The reader will find themselves going on this journey with them, experiencing what they experienced, both in their hearts and in the psychedelic journeys they have. The second half of PiHKAL is called The Chemical Story, and it contains detailed instructions for, and effects of, the synthesis of 179 psychedelic phenethylamines which were mostly discovered by Shulgin himself. For each substance there is information on its synthesis, suggested effective dosage, duration, and detailed commentary on the subjective effects that were experienced. This book appeals to adults of all ages and cultures, and to the psychedelically experienced and inexperienced alike.</p></div>", "isbn": "9780963009609", "path": "Alexander Shulgin/Pihkal_ A Chemical Love Story (252)", "has_cover": 1, "flags": 1, "author_ids": ["338", "339"], "series_ids": null, "publisher_ids": ["153"], "language_ids": ["1"], "tag_ids": ["43", "92", "239", "241", "242"], "identifier_ids": ["864", "865", "863"], "order_by": "2023-01-03 18:10:07.521546+00:00", "authors": [{"id": 338, "name": "Alexander Shulgin", "count": 1, "avg_rating": 8.0, "sort": "Shulgin, Alexander"}, {"id": 339, "name": "Ann Shulgin", "count": 1, "avg_rating": 8.0, "sort": "Shulgin, Ann"}], "publishers": [{"id": 153, "name": "Transform Press", "count": 1, "avg_rating": 8.0, "sort": "Transform Press"}], "languages": [{"id": 1, "name": "ENG", "count": 448, "avg_rating": 8.366795366795367, "sort": "ENG"}], "tags": [{"id": 43, "name": "Self Help", "count": 37, "avg_rating": 8.0625, "sort": 37}, {"id": 92, "name": "Biography", "count": 32, "avg_rating": 8.214285714285714, "sort": 32}, {"id": 239, "name": "Personal Memoirs", "count": 1, "avg_rating": 8.0, "sort": 1}, {"id": 241, "name": "Substance Abuse & Addictions", "count": 1, "avg_rating": 8.0, "sort": 1}, {"id": 242, "name": "Drugs", "count": 1, "avg_rating": 8.0, "sort": 1}], "identifiers": [{"id": 863, "book": 252, "type": "isbn", "val": "9780963009609", "sort": "isbn", "name": "ISBN", "path": "https://www.worldcat.org/isbn/9780963009609"}, {"id": 865, "book": 252, "type": "google", "val": "O8AdHBGybpcC", "sort": "google", "name": "Google Books", "path": "https://books.google.com/books?id=O8AdHBGybpcC"}, {"id": 864, "book": 252, "type": "goodreads", "val": "886113", "sort": "goodreads", "name": "Goodreads", "path": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/886113"}], "custom_types": "eBook", "custom_reading_list": 1, "custom_read_date": null, "custom_lists": [], "custom_lists_ids": null, "custom_clean": 1}, {"id": 251, "title": "Build: An Unorthodox Guide to Making Things Worth Making", "rating": 4, "timestamp": "2023-01-03 18:06:36.542129+00:00", "pubdate": "2022-05-03", "last_modified": "2025-05-29 14:22:59.457405+00:00", "size": 9944039, "comments": "<div>\n<p>Written for anyone who wants to grow at work\u2014from young grads navigating their first jobs to CEOs deciding whether to sell their company\u2014 Build is full of personal stories, practical advice and fascinating insights into some of the most impactful products and people of the 20th century.</p>\n<p>Each quick 5-20 page entry builds on the previous one, charting Tony\u2019s personal journey from a product designer to a leader, from a startup founder to an executive to a mentor.

These models have obtained state-of-the-art results on datasets and tasks where large training sets are available. However, they do not transfer well to new applications with no training data, and are outperformed by unsupervised term-frequency methods such as BM25. In this work, we explore the limits of contrastive learning as a way to train unsupervised dense retrievers and show that it leads to strong performance in various retrieval settings. On the BEIR benchmark our unsupervised model outperforms BM25 on 11 out of 15 datasets for the Recall@100. When used as pre-training before fine-tuning, either on a few thousands in-domain examples or on the large MS~MARCO dataset, our contrastive model leads to improvements on the BEIR benchmark. Finally, we evaluate our approach for multi-lingual retrieval, where training data is even scarcer than for English, and show that our approach leads to strong unsupervised performance. Our model also exhibits strong cross-lingual transfer when fine-tuned on supervised English data only and evaluated on low resources language such as Swahili. We show that our unsupervised models can perform cross-lingual retrieval between different scripts, such as retrieving English documents from Arabic queries, which would not be possible with term matching methods.</p></div>", "isbn": null, "path": "Gautier Izacard/Unsupervised Dense Information Retr (247)", "has_cover": 1, "flags": 1, "author_ids": ["325", "326", "327", "328", "329", "330", "331"], "series_ids": null, "publisher_ids": ["125"], "language_ids": ["1"], "tag_ids": ["186", "189", "191", "237"], "identifier_ids": ["927"], "order_by": "2022-12-05 19:21:52.360004+00:00", "authors": [{"id": 329, "name": "Piotr Bojanowski", "count": 1, "avg_rating": null, "sort": "Bojanowski, Piotr"}, {"id": 326, "name": "Mathilde Caron", "count": 1, "avg_rating": null, "sort": "Caron, Mathilde"}, {"id": 331, "name": "Edouard Grave", "count": 1, "avg_rating": null, "sort": "Grave, Edouard"}, {"id": 327, "name": "Lucas Hosseini", "count": 1, "avg_rating": null, "sort": "Hosseini, Lucas"}, {"id": 325, "name": "Gautier Izacard", "count": 1, "avg_rating": null, "sort": "Izacard, Gautier"}, {"id": 330, "name": "Armand Joulin", "count": 1, "avg_rating": null, "sort": "Joulin, Armand"}, {"id": 328, "name": "Sebastian Riedel", "count": 1, "avg_rating": null, "sort": "Riedel, Sebastian"}], "publishers": [{"id": 125, "name": "arXiv", "count": 11, "avg_rating": null, "sort": "arXiv"}], "languages": [{"id": 1, "name": "ENG", "count": 448, "avg_rating": 8.366795366795367, "sort": "ENG"}], "tags": [{"id": 191, "name": "Computer Science", "count": 51, "avg_rating": 8.0, "sort": 51}, {"id": 189, "name": "Deep Learning", "count": 15, "avg_rating": 8.0, "sort": 15}, {"id": 186, "name": "Machine Learning", "count": 14, "avg_rating": 8.0, "sort": 14}, {"id": 237, "name": "Information Retrieval", "count": 1, "avg_rating": null, "sort": 1}], "identifiers": [{"id": 927, "book": 247, "type": "arxiv", "val": "2112.09118", "sort": "arxiv", "name": "arXiv", "path": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.09118"}], "custom_types": "Paper", "custom_reading_list": 0, "custom_read_date": null, "custom_lists": [{"id": 3, "value": "Machine Learning.Deep Learning", "sort": "Machine Learning.Deep Learning"}], "custom_lists_ids": ["3"], "custom_clean": 1}, {"id": 246, "title": "A Rubric for ML Production Readiness and Technical Debt Reduction", "rating": null, "timestamp": "2022-10-27 09:23:10.337237+00:00", "pubdate": "2017-01-05", "last_modified": "2025-05-29 14:22:59.457405+00:00", "size": 500055, "comments": "<div>\n<p>Creating reliable, production-level machine learning systems brings on a host of concerns not found in small toy examples or even large offline research experiments.

This goal has forced organizations to evolve their development processes. We report on a study that we conducted on observing software teams at Microsoft as they develop AI-based applications. We consider a nine-stage workflow process informed by prior experiences developing AI applications (e.g., search and NLP) and data science tools (e.g. application diagnostics and bug reporting). We found that various Microsoft teams have united this workflow into preexisting, well-evolved, Agile-like software engineering processes, providing insights about several essential engineering challenges that organizations may face in creating large-scale AI solutions for the marketplace. We collected some best practices from Microsoft teams to address these challenges. In addition, we have identified three aspects of the AI domain that make it fundamentally different from prior software application domains: 1) discovering, managing, and versioning the data needed for machine learning applications is much more complex and difficult than other types of software engineering, 2) model customization and model reuse require very different skills than are typically found in software teams, and 3) AI components are more difficult to handle as distinct modules than traditional software components - models may be \"entangled\" in complex ways and experience non-monotonic error behavior.

Our intuition is simple: learn what the world looks like and how it is described from paired text-image data, and learn how the world moves from unsupervised video footage. Make-A-Video has three advantages: (1) it accelerates training of the T2V model (it does not need to learn visual and multimodal representations from scratch), (2) it does not require paired text-video data, and (3) the generated videos inherit the vastness (diversity in aesthetic, fantastical depictions, etc.) of today's image generation models. We design a simple yet effective way to build on T2I models with novel and effective spatial-temporal modules.

In order to clarify the intended use cases of machine learning models and minimize their usage in contexts for which they are not well suited, we recommend that released models be accompanied by documentation detailing their performance characteristics. In this paper, we propose a framework that we call model cards, to encourage such transparent model reporting. Model cards are short documents accompanying trained machine learning models that provide benchmarked evaluation in a variety of conditions, such as across different cultural, demographic, or phenotypic groups (e.g., race, geographic location, sex, Fitzpatrick skin type) and intersectional groups (e.g., age and race, or sex and Fitzpatrick skin type) that are relevant to the intended application domains. Model cards also disclose the context in which models are intended to be used, details of the performance evaluation procedures, and other relevant information. While we focus primarily on human-centered machine learning models in the application fields of computer vision and natural language processing, this framework can be used to document any trained machine learning model. To solidify the concept, we provide cards for two supervised models: One trained to detect smiling faces in images, and one trained to detect toxic comments in text. We propose model cards as a step towards the responsible democratization of machine learning and related AI technology, increasing transparency into how well AI technology works. We hope this work encourages those releasing trained machine learning models to accompany model releases with similar detailed evaluation numbers and other relevant documentation.</p></div>", "isbn": null, "path": "Margaret Mitchell/Model Cards for Model Reporting (239)", "has_cover": 1, "flags": 1, "author_ids": ["278", "279", "280", "281", "282", "283", "284", "285", "286"], "series_ids": null, "publisher_ids": ["125"], "language_ids": ["1"], "tag_ids": ["186", "189", "191"], "identifier_ids": ["835"], "order_by": "2022-10-12 20:13:38.586617+00:00", "authors": [{"id": 281, "name": "Parker Barnes", "count": 1, "avg_rating": null, "sort": "Barnes, Parker"}, {"id": 286, "name": "Timnit Gebru", "count": 1, "avg_rating": null, "sort": "Gebru, Timnit"}, {"id": 283, "name": "Ben Hutchinson", "count": 1, "avg_rating": null, "sort": "Hutchinson, Ben"}, {"id": 278, "name": "Margaret Mitchell", "count": 2, "avg_rating": null, "sort": "Mitchell, Margaret"}, {"id": 285, "name": "Inioluwa Deborah Raji", "count": 1, "avg_rating": null, "sort": "Raji, Inioluwa Deborah"}, {"id": 284, "name": "Elena Spitzer", "count": 1, "avg_rating": null, "sort": "Spitzer, Elena"}, {"id": 282, "name": "Lucy Vasserman", "count": 1, "avg_rating": null, "sort": "Vasserman, Lucy"}, {"id": 279, "name": "Simone Wu", "count": 1, "avg_rating": null, "sort": "Wu, Simone"}, {"id": 280, "name": "Andrew Zaldivar", "count": 1, "avg_rating": null, "sort": "Zaldivar, Andrew"}], "publishers": [{"id": 125, "name": "arXiv", "count": 11, "avg_rating": null, "sort": "arXiv"}], "languages": [{"id": 1, "name": "ENG", "count": 448, "avg_rating": 8.366795366795367, "sort": "ENG"}], "tags": [{"id": 191, "name": "Computer Science", "count": 51, "avg_rating": 8.0, "sort": 51}, {"id": 189, "name": "Deep Learning", "count": 15, "avg_rating": 8.0, "sort": 15}, {"id": 186, "name": "Machine Learning", "count": 14, "avg_rating": 8.0, "sort": 14}], "identifiers": [{"id": 835, "book": 239, "type": "arxiv", "val": "1810.03993", "sort": "arxiv", "name": "arXiv", "path": "https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.03993"}], "custom_types": "Paper", "custom_reading_list": 0, "custom_read_date": "2023-04-11", "custom_lists": [{"id": 22, "value": "Machine Learning", "sort": "Machine Learning"}], "custom_lists_ids": ["22"], "custom_clean": 1}, {"id": 238, "title": "Robust Speech Recognition via Large-Scale Weak Supervision", "rating": null, "timestamp": "2022-10-12 20:13:38.408058+00:00", "pubdate": "2022-09-21", "last_modified": "2025-05-29 14:22:59.457405+00:00", "size": 853124, "comments": "<div>\n<p>We study the capabilities of speech processing systems trained simply to predict large amounts of transcripts of audio on the internet.

Scott Fitzgerald that follows a cast of characters living in the fictional town of West Egg on prosperous Long Island in the summer of 1922. The story primarily concerns the young and mysterious millionaire Jay Gatsby and his quixotic passion and obsession for the beautiful former debutante Daisy Buchanan. Considered to be Fitzgerald's magnum opus, The Great Gatsby explores themes of decadence, idealism, resistance to change, social upheaval, and excess, creating a portrait of the Jazz Age or the Roaring Twenties that has been described as a cautionary tale regarding the American Dream. Fitzgerald-inspired by the parties he had attended while visiting Long Island's north shore-began planning the novel in 1923, desiring to produce, in his words, \"something new-something extraordinary and beautiful and simple and intricately patterned.</p>\n<p>\" Progress was slow, with Fitzgerald completing his first draft following a move to the French Riviera in 1924. His editor, Maxwell Perkins, felt the book was vague and persuaded the author to revise over the next winter. Fitzgerald was repeatedly ambivalent about the book's title and he considered a variety of alternatives, including titles that referenced the Roman character Trimalchio; the title he was last documented to have desired was Under the Red, White, and Blue. In its first year, the book sold only 20,000 copies. Fitzgerald died in 1940, believing himself to be a failure and his work forgotten. However, the novel experienced a revival during World War II, and became a part of American high school curricula and numerous stage and film adaptations in the following decades. Today, The Great Gatsby is widely considered to be a literary classic and a contender for the title \"Great American Novel\". In 1998, the Modern Library editorial board voted it the 20th century's best American novel and second best English-language novel of the same time period.</p></div>", "isbn": "9789176371213", "path": "F.

In this work, we present a new approach for \"personalization\" of text-to-image diffusion models (specializing them to users' needs). Given as input just a few images of a subject, we fine-tune a pretrained text-to-image model (Imagen, although our method is not limited to a specific model) such that it learns to bind a unique identifier with that specific subject. Once the subject is embedded in the output domain of the model, the unique identifier can then be used to synthesize fully-novel photorealistic images of the subject contextualized in different scenes. By leveraging the semantic prior embedded in the model with a new autogenous class-specific prior preservation loss, our technique enables synthesizing the subject in diverse scenes, poses, views, and lighting conditions that do not appear in the reference images. We apply our technique to several previously-unassailable tasks, including subject recontextualization, text-guided view synthesis, appearance modification, and artistic rendering (all while preserving the subject's key features).</p></div>", "isbn": null, "path": "Nataniel Ruiz/DreamBooth Fine Tuning T2I Diffusio (201)", "has_cover": 1, "flags": 1, "author_ids": ["211", "212", "213", "214", "215", "216"], "series_ids": null, "publisher_ids": ["125"], "language_ids": ["1"], "tag_ids": ["188", "189", "191", "192"], "identifier_ids": ["724"], "order_by": "2022-10-10 10:33:15+00:00", "authors": [{"id": 216, "name": "Kfir Aberman", "count": 1, "avg_rating": null, "sort": "Aberman, Kfir"}, {"id": 213, "name": "Varun Jampani", "count": 1, "avg_rating": null, "sort": "Jampani, Varun"}, {"id": 212, "name": "Yuanzhen Li", "count": 1, "avg_rating": null, "sort": "Li, Yuanzhen"}, {"id": 214, "name": "Yael Pritch", "count": 1, "avg_rating": null, "sort": "Pritch, Yael"}, {"id": 215, "name": "Michael Rubinstein", "count": 1, "avg_rating": null, "sort": "Rubinstein, Michael"}, {"id": 211, "name": "Nataniel Ruiz", "count": 1, "avg_rating": null, "sort": "Ruiz, Nataniel"}], "publishers": [{"id": 125, "name": "arXiv", "count": 11, "avg_rating": null, "sort": "arXiv"}], "languages": [{"id": 1, "name": "ENG", "count": 448, "avg_rating": 8.366795366795367, "sort": "ENG"}], "tags": [{"id": 191, "name": "Computer Science", "count": 51, "avg_rating": 8.0, "sort": 51}, {"id": 189, "name": "Deep Learning", "count": 15, "avg_rating": 8.0, "sort": 15}, {"id": 192, "name": "Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition", "count": 4, "avg_rating": null, "sort": 4}, {"id": 188, "name": "Paper", "count": 2, "avg_rating": null, "sort": 2}], "identifiers": [{"id": 724, "book": 201, "type": "arxiv", "val": "2208.12242", "sort": "arxiv", "name": "arXiv", "path": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.12242"}], "custom_types": "Paper", "custom_reading_list": 0, "custom_read_date": "2022-08-17", "custom_lists": [{"id": 3, "value": "Machine Learning.Deep Learning", "sort": "Machine Learning.Deep Learning"}], "custom_lists_ids": ["3"], "custom_clean": 1}, {"id": 226, "title": "Deep Learning in Python: Master Data Science and Machine Learning With Modern Neural Networks Written in Python, Theano, and TensorFlow (Machine Learning in Python)", "rating": 3, "timestamp": "2022-10-08 20:04:04+00:00", "pubdate": "2016-03-11", "last_modified": "2025-05-29 14:22:59.457405+00:00", "size": 208267, "comments": "<div>\n<p>Deep learning is making waves. At the time of this writing (March 2016), Google\u2019s AlghaGo program just beat 9-dan professional Go player Lee Sedol at the game of Go, a Chinese board game.</p>\n<p>Experts in the field of Artificial Intelligence thought we were 10 years away from achieving a victory against a top professional Go player, but progress seems to have accelerated!</p>\n<p>While deep learning is a complex subject, it is not any more difficult to learn than any other machine learning algorithm. I wrote this book to introduce you to the basics of neural networks. You will get along fine with undergraduate-level math and programming skill.</p>\n<p>All the materials in this book can be downloaded and installed for free. We will use the Python programming language, along with the numerical computing library Numpy. I will also show you in the later chapters how to build a deep network using Theano and TensorFlow, which are libraries built specifically for deep learning and can accelerate computation by taking advantage of the GPU.</p>\n<p>Unlike other machine learning algorithms, deep learning is particularly powerful because it automatically learns features. That means you don\u2019t need to spend your time trying to come up with and test \u201ckernels\u201d or \u201cinteraction effects\u201d - something only statisticians love to do. Instead, we will let the neural network learn these things for us. Each layer of the neural network learns a different abstraction than the previous layers. For example, in image classification, the first layer might learn different strokes, and in the next layer put the strokes together to learn shapes, and in the next layer put the shapes together to form facial features, and in the next layer have a high level representation of faces.</p>\n<p>On top of all this, deep learning is known for winning its fair share Kaggle contests. These are machine learning contests that are open to anyone in the world who are allowed to use any machine learning technique they want. Deep learning is that powerful.</p>\n<p>Do you want a gentle introduction to this \u201cdark art\u201d, with practical code examples that you can try right away and apply to your own data? Then this book is for you.</p>\n<p>Who is this book NOT for?</p>\n<p>Deep Learning and Neural Networks are usually taught at the upper-year undergraduate level. That should give you some idea of the type of knowledge you need to understand this kind of material.</p>\n<p>You absolutely need exposure to calculus to understand deep learning, no matter how simple the instructor makes things. Linear algebra would help. I will assume familiarity with Python (although it is an easy language to pick up). You will need to have some concept of machine learning. If you know about algorithms like logistic regression already, this book is perfect for you. If not, you might want to check out my \u201cprerequisites\u201d book, at: http://amzn.com/B01D7GDRQ2</p>\n<p>On the other hand, this book is more like a casual primer than a dry textbook. If you are looking for material on more advanced topics, like LSTMs, convolutional neural networks, or reinforcement learning, I have online courses that teach this material, for example: https://www.udemy.com/deep-learning-c...</p>\n<p>New libraries like TensorFlow are being updated constantly. This is not an encyclopedia for these libraries (as such a thing would be impossible to keep up to date). In the one (1!!!) month since the book was first published, no less than THREE new wrapper libraries for TensorFlow have been released to make coding deep networks easier.</p></div>", "isbn": null, "path": "Lazy Programmer/Deep Learning in Python_ Master Dat (226)", "has_cover": 1, "flags": 1, "author_ids": ["262"], "series_ids": null, "publisher_ids": ["117"], "language_ids": ["1"], "tag_ids": ["190", "217"], "identifier_ids": ["842", "843"], "order_by": "2022-10-08 20:04:04+00:00", "authors": [{"id": 262, "name": "Lazy Programmer", "count": 1, "avg_rating": 6.0, "sort": "Programmer, Lazy"}], "publishers": [{"id": 117, "name": "Independently Published", "count": 15, "avg_rating": 7.6, "sort": "Independently Published"}], "languages": [{"id": 1, "name": "ENG", "count": 448, "avg_rating": 8.366795366795367, "sort": "ENG"}], "tags": [{"id": 190, "name": "Programming", "count": 54, "avg_rating": 7.857142857142857, "sort": 54}, {"id": 217, "name": "Python", "count": 14, "avg_rating": 7.2727272727272725, "sort": 14}], "identifiers": [{"id": 843, "book": 226, "type": "goodreads", "val": "29496091", "sort": "goodreads", "name": "Goodreads", "path": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29496091"}, {"id": 842, "book": 226, "type": "amazon", "val": "B01CVJ19E8", "sort": "amazon", "name": "Amazon", "path": "https://amazon.com/dp/B01CVJ19E8"}], "custom_types": "eBook", "custom_reading_list": 1, "custom_read_date": null, "custom_lists": [{"id": 1, "value": "Programming.Python", "sort": "Programming.Python"}], "custom_lists_ids": ["1"], "custom_clean": 1}, {"id": 200, "title": "Jukebox: A Generative Model for Music", "rating": null, "timestamp": "2022-10-06 10:33:15.488347+00:00", "pubdate": "2020-04-30", "last_modified": "2025-05-29 14:22:59.457405+00:00", "size": 4337599, "comments": "<div>\n<p>We introduce Jukebox, a model that generates music with singing in the raw audio domain.

Lurking beneath it all is a collective, instinctual fear of the Darkness. For Kalgash knows only the perpetual light of day; to its inhabitants, a gathering twilight portends unspeakable horror. And only a handful of people on the planet are prepared to face the truth, their six suns are setting all at once for the first time in over two thousand years, signaling the end of civilization as it explodes in the awesome splendor of Nightfall.</p>\n<p>Encompassing the psychology of disaster, the tenacity of the human spirit, and, ultimately, the regenerative power of hope, Nightfall is a tale rich in character and suspense that only the unique collaboration of Isaac Asimov and Robert Silverberg could create.</p></div>", "isbn": "9780330320962", "path": "Isaac Asimov/Nightfall (177)", "has_cover": 1, "flags": 1, "author_ids": ["188", "189"], "series_ids": null, "publisher_ids": ["120"], "language_ids": ["1"], "tag_ids": ["75", "76", "153"], "identifier_ids": ["549", "548", "547"], "order_by": "2022-10-06 09:49:13.818458+00:00", "authors": [{"id": 188, "name": "Isaac Asimov", "count": 1, "avg_rating": 8.0, "sort": "Asimov, Isaac"}, {"id": 189, "name": "Robert Silverberg", "count": 1, "avg_rating": 8.0, "sort": "Silverberg, Robert"}], "publishers": [{"id": 120, "name": "Pan Books", "count": 1, "avg_rating": 8.0, "sort": "Pan Books"}], "languages": [{"id": 1, "name": "ENG", "count": 448, "avg_rating": 8.366795366795367, "sort": "ENG"}], "tags": [{"id": 76, "name": "Fantasy", "count": 146, "avg_rating": 8.772727272727273, "sort": 146}, {"id": 75, "name": "Science Fiction", "count": 110, "avg_rating": 8.74074074074074, "sort": 110}, {"id": 153, "name": "Classics", "count": 38, "avg_rating": 8.481481481481481, "sort": 38}], "identifiers": [{"id": 547, "book": 177, "type": "isbn", "val": "9780330320962", "sort": "isbn", "name": "ISBN", "path": "https://www.worldcat.org/isbn/9780330320962"}, {"id": 548, "book": 177, "type": "google", "val": "TLY9PgAACAAJ", "sort": "google", "name": "Google Books", "path": "https://books.google.com/books?id=TLY9PgAACAAJ"}, {"id": 549, "book": 177, "type": "goodreads", "val": "99245", "sort": "goodreads", "name": "Goodreads", "path": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/99245"}], "custom_types": "eBook", "custom_reading_list": 0, "custom_read_date": null, "custom_lists": [], "custom_lists_ids": null, "custom_clean": 1}, {"id": 176, "title": "Alleen Op de Wereld", "rating": null, "timestamp": "2022-10-06 09:40:35.729610+00:00", "pubdate": "2006-08-15", "last_modified": "2025-05-29 14:22:59.457405+00:00", "size": 397201, "comments": "<div>\n<p>Alleen op de wereld (Frans: Sans famille) is de titel van een avonturenverhaal van de Franse schrijver Hector Malot. Het boek werd voor het eerst gepubliceerd in 1878. Het boek is meerdere keren verfilmd. Hector-Henri Malot (La Bouille bij Rouen, 20 mei 1830 - Fontenay-sous-Bois, 17 juli 1907) was een Franse schrijver. Hij studeerde rechten in Rouen en Parijs, maar uiteindelijk werd literatuur zijn passie. Hij werkte als literatuurcriticus voor L'Opinion Nationale en als theatercriticus voor Lloyd Fran\u00e7ais. Zijn veruit meest bekende boek is Alleen op de wereld. Het boek Alleen op de wereld gaat over de vondeling Remi. Jer\u00f4me Barberin woont met zijn vrouw in het (fictieve) dorpje Chavanon, vermoedelijk in Puy-de-D\u00f4me. Hij is meestal niet thuis, want hij werkt als steenhouwer in Parijs. Op een dag vindt hij een kind van een paar maanden. Aan de kleertjes kan Barberin zien dat het kind rijke ouders heeft. De vraag speelt op waarom het kind in Parijs te vondeling is gelegd. Jer\u00f4me Barberin is een vrij ruwe man die niet in een kind ge\u00efnteresseerd is. Hij hoopt echter dat de rijke ouders het kind komen ophalen en hem een beloning geven.

De ontdekking van de hemel, waarin alle thema's en obsessies uit het werk van Harry Mulisch in 65 hoofdstukken bijeenkomen, is tegelijk een psychologische roman, een tijdroman, een ontwikkelingsroman, een avonturenstroom en een allesoverkoepelend mysteriespel. Mulisch' ars combinatoria, onderhoudend, verrasend, grappig, duister, krankzinnig, even eigenzinnig als lichtvoetig uitgevoerd, lijkt na deze roman niet meer te overtreffen. - Die Zeit Het is aan geen twijfel onderhevig, dat Harry Mulisch zich nu definitief in de rijen van de grote Europese vertellers heeft gevoegd. Het is een gelukkige omstandighjeid, dat wij in Harry Mulisch een buurman hebben die ons iets vertellen kan over God en de wereld en over Europa en Duitsland en over het labyrint in onze borst - S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung Net als Homerus, Dante en Milton gebruikt Mulisch de kosmos als toneel en zijn thema is de geschiedenis en de betekenis van alles. - Jamie James, Wall Street Journal Recensie(s) NBD|Biblion recensie Deze turfdikke Mulisch doet vooral denken aan de intellectuele feuilletons van Thomas Mann ('De toverberg', 'Doctor Faustus'): uiterst leesbaar en hoogst interessant tegelijk. Het is ondermeer de artistieke verbeelding van het thema dat in 'De compositie van de wereld' al studieus werd benaderd: de paradox als het laatste woord in zaken van hoofd en hart. Dat thema is ingenieus doorgecomponeerd in de levensgeschiedenissen van twee vrienden (waarvoor de schaker Donner en Mulisch zelf duidelijk model stonden) en de manipulaties van die levens door enkele engelen. Deze engelen zijn ontsteld door de technische almacht van de mens in leven (genetica) en dood (Auschwitz) en willen het verbond tussen God en mens ongedaan maken. De 65 hoofdstukken zijn gesteld in opvallend soepel en verzorgd Nederlands en geven een spectaculair panorama van de preoccupaties en stilistische vaardigheden van deze duivelskunstenaar.</p></div>", "isbn": "9789023461234", "path": "Mulish, Harry/De ontdekking van de hemel (165)", "has_cover": 1, "flags": 1, "author_ids": ["170"], "series_ids": null, "publisher_ids": ["108"], "language_ids": ["2"], "tag_ids": null, "identifier_ids": ["1430", "1431", "1432"], "order_by": "2022-10-06 09:40:27.410128+00:00", "authors": [{"id": 170, "name": "Mulish| Harry", "count": 1, "avg_rating": null, "sort": "Mulish, Harry"}], "publishers": [{"id": 108, "name": "De Bezige Bij", "count": 1, "avg_rating": null, "sort": "De Bezige Bij"}], "languages": [{"id": 2, "name": "NLD", "count": 62, "avg_rating": 8.0, "sort": "NLD"}], "identifiers": [{"id": 1432, "book": 165, "type": "isbn", "val": "9789023461234", "sort": "isbn", "name": "ISBN", "path": "https://www.worldcat.org/isbn/9789023461234"}, {"id": 1431, "book": 165, "type": "amazon_nl", "val": "9023461231", "sort": "amazon_nl", "name": "Amazon NL", "path": "https://amazon.nl/dp/9023461231"}, {"id": 1430, "book": 165, "type": "amazon", "val": "9023461231", "sort": "amazon", "name": "Amazon", "path": "https://amazon.com/dp/9023461231"}], "custom_types": "eBook", "custom_reading_list": 0, "custom_read_date": null, "custom_lists": [], "custom_lists_ids": null, "custom_clean": 1}, {"id": 164, "title": "Scar Tissue", "rating": 4, "timestamp": "2022-10-06 09:38:14.205357+00:00", "pubdate": "2004-01-01", "last_modified": "2025-05-29 14:22:59.457405+00:00", "size": 73076128, "comments": "<div>\n<p>Now in paperback, the New York Times bestseller by one of rock's most provocative figures Scar Tissue is Anthony Kiedis's searingly honest memoir of a life spent in the fast lane.</p>\n<p>In 1983, four self-described \"knuckleheads\" burst out of the mosh-pitted mosaic of the neo-punk rock scene in L.A. with their own unique brand of cosmic hardcore mayhem funk.

Whether he's recollecting the influence of the beautiful, strong women who have been his muses, or retracing a journey that has included appearances as diverse as a performance before half a million people at Woodstock or an audience of one at the humble compound of the exiled Dalai Lama, Kiedis shares a compelling story about the price of success and excess.</p>\n<p>Scar Tissue is a story of dedication and debauchery, of intrigue and integrity, of recklessness and redemption--a story that could only have come out of the world of rock.</p></div>", "isbn": "9788494588655", "path": "Anthony Kiedis/Scar Tissue (164)", "has_cover": 1, "flags": 1, "author_ids": ["169"], "series_ids": null, "publisher_ids": ["91"], "language_ids": ["1"], "tag_ids": ["92", "132"], "identifier_ids": ["607", "608", "606", "605"], "order_by": "2022-10-06 09:38:14.205357+00:00", "authors": [{"id": 169, "name": "Anthony Kiedis", "count": 1, "avg_rating": 8.0, "sort": "Kiedis, Anthony"}], "publishers": [{"id": 91, "name": "Hachette UK", "count": 2, "avg_rating": 9.0, "sort": "Hachette UK"}], "languages": [{"id": 1, "name": "ENG", "count": 448, "avg_rating": 8.366795366795367, "sort": "ENG"}], "tags": [{"id": 92, "name": "Biography", "count": 32, "avg_rating": 8.214285714285714, "sort": 32}, {"id": 132, "name": "Music", "count": 6, "avg_rating": 7.6, "sort": 6}], "identifiers": [{"id": 605, "book": 164, "type": "isbn", "val": "9788494588655", "sort": "isbn", "name": "ISBN", "path": "https://www.worldcat.org/isbn/9788494588655"}, {"id": 606, "book": 164, "type": "google", "val": "X4N-DwAAQBAJ", "sort": "google", "name": "Google Books", "path": "https://books.google.com/books?id=X4N-DwAAQBAJ"}, {"id": 608, "book": 164, "type": "goodreads", "val": "96647", "sort": "goodreads", "name": "Goodreads", "path": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/96647"}, {"id": 607, "book": 164, "type": "amazon", "val": "1401307450", "sort": "amazon", "name": "Amazon", "path": "https://amazon.com/dp/1401307450"}], "custom_types": "eBook", "custom_reading_list": 0, "custom_read_date": null, "custom_lists": [], "custom_lists_ids": null, "custom_clean": 1}, {"id": 161, "title": "The Importance of Being Earnest", "rating": 4, "timestamp": "2022-10-06 09:37:00.744877+00:00", "pubdate": "1895-02-14", "last_modified": "2025-05-29 14:22:59.457405+00:00", "size": 10866936, "comments": "<div>\n<p>Here is Oscar Wilde's most brilliant tour de force, a witty and buoyant comedy of manners that has delighted millions in countless productions since its first performance in London's St. James' Theatre on February 14, 1895.\" The Importance of Being Earnest\" is celebrated not only for the lighthearted ingenuity of its plot, but for its inspired dialogue, rich with scintillating epigrams still savored by all who enjoy artful conversation.<br>From the play's effervescent beginnings in Algernon Moncrieff's London flat to its hilarious denouement in the drawing room of Jack Worthing's country manor in Hertfordshire, this comic masterpiece keeps audiences breathlessly anticipating a new bon mot or a fresh twist of plot moment to moment.

Living Down and Out in Paris and London , repudiating respectable imperialist society, and reinventing himself as George Orwell. His 1933 debut book (ostensibly a novel, but overwhelmingly autobiographical) was rejected by that elitist publisher T. S. Eliot, perhaps because its close-up portrait of lowlife was too pungent for comfort.</p>\n<p>In Paris, Orwell lived in verminous rooms and washed dishes at the overpriced \"Hotel X,\" in a remarkably filthy, 110-degree kitchen. He met \"eccentric people \u2013 people who have fallen into solitary, half-mad grooves of life and given up trying to be normal or decent.\" Though Orwell's tone is that of an outraged reformer, it's surprising how entertaining many of his adventures are: gnawing poverty only enlivens the imagination, and the wild characters he met often swindled each other and themselves. The wackiest tale involves a miser who ate cats, wore newspapers for underwear, invested 6,000 francs in cocaine, and hid it in a face-powder tin when the cops raided. They had to free him, because the apparently controlled substance turned out to be face powder instead of cocaine.</p>\n<p>In London, Orwell studied begging with a crippled expert named Bozo, a great storyteller and philosopher. Orwell devotes a chapter to the fine points of London guttersnipe slang. Years later, he would put his lexical bent to work by inventing Newspeak, and draw on his down-and-out experience to evoke the plight of the Proles in 1984. Though marred by hints of unexamined anti-Semitism, Orwell's debut remains, as The Nation put it, \"the most lucid portrait of poverty in the English language.\" --Tim Appelo</p></div>", "isbn": "9780156262248", "path": "George Orwell/Down and Out in Paris and London (159)", "has_cover": 1, "flags": 1, "author_ids": ["167"], "series_ids": null, "publisher_ids": ["90"], "language_ids": ["1"], "tag_ids": ["57", "60", "90", "92", "153"], "identifier_ids": ["483", "484", "481", "482"], "order_by": "2022-10-06 09:35:53.313990+00:00", "authors": [{"id": 167, "name": "George Orwell", "count": 4, "avg_rating": 8.666666666666666, "sort": "Orwell, George"}], "publishers": [{"id": 90, "name": "Penguin Random House", "count": 21, "avg_rating": 8.75, "sort": "Penguin Random House"}], "languages": [{"id": 1, "name": "ENG", "count": 448, "avg_rating": 8.366795366795367, "sort": "ENG"}], "tags": [{"id": 153, "name": "Classics", "count": 38, "avg_rating": 8.481481481481481, "sort": 38}, {"id": 92, "name": "Biography", "count": 32, "avg_rating": 8.214285714285714, "sort": 32}, {"id": 60, "name": "History", "count": 27, "avg_rating": 8.416666666666666, "sort": 27}, {"id": 57, "name": "Politics", "count": 24, "avg_rating": 8.416666666666666, "sort": 24}, {"id": 90, "name": "Travel", "count": 4, "avg_rating": 7.5, "sort": 4}], "identifiers": [{"id": 482, "book": 159, "type": "isbn", "val": "9780156262248", "sort": "isbn", "name": "ISBN", "path": "https://www.worldcat.org/isbn/9780156262248"}, {"id": 481, "book": 159, "type": "google", "val": "m5vIVN7LjtgC", "sort": "google", "name": "Google Books", "path": "https://books.google.com/books?id=m5vIVN7LjtgC"}, {"id": 484, "book": 159, "type": "goodreads", "val": "34304872", "sort": "goodreads", "name": "Goodreads", "path": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34304872"}, {"id": 483, "book": 159, "type": "amazon", "val": "015626224X", "sort": "amazon", "name": "Amazon", "path": "https://amazon.com/dp/015626224X"}], "custom_types": "eBook", "custom_reading_list": 0, "custom_read_date": null, "custom_lists": [], "custom_lists_ids": null, "custom_clean": 1}, {"id": 157, "title": "A Confederacy of Dunces", "rating": 4, "timestamp": "2022-10-06 09:34:19.501438+00:00", "pubdate": "1994-04-01", "last_modified": "2025-05-29 14:22:59.457405+00:00", "size": 572097, "comments": "<div>\n<p>Released by Louisiana State University Press in 1980, A Confederacy of Dunces is nothing short of a publishing phenomenon.

No one in her family, in either the United States or Colombia, spoke of infectious diseases, and even into her thirties, she only knew that her aunt had died of a rare illness called Chagas. But as Hern\u00e1ndez dug deeper, she discovered that Chagas\u2014or the kissing bug disease\u2014is more prevalent in the United States than the Zika virus. Today, more than three hundred thousand Americans have Chagas.</p>\n<p>Why do some infectious diseases make headlines and others fall by the wayside? After her aunt's death, Hern\u00e1ndez begins searching for answers about who our nation chooses to take care of and who we ignore. Crisscrossing the country, she interviews patients, epidemiologists, and even veterinarians with the Department of Defense. She learns that outside of Latin America, the United States is the only country with the native insects\u2014the \"kissing bugs\"\u2014that carry the Chagas parasite. She spends a night in southwest Texas hunting the dreaded bug with university researchers. She also gets to know patients, like a mother whose premature baby was born infected with the parasite, his heart already damaged. And she meets one cardiologist battling the disease in Los Angeles County with local volunteers.</p>\n<p>The Kissing Bug tells the story of how poverty, racism, and public policies have conspired to keep this disease hidden\u2014and how the disease intersects with Hern\u00e1ndez's own identity as a niece, sister, and daughter; a queer woman; a writer and researcher; and a citizen of a country that is only beginning to address the harms caused by Chagas and the dangers it poses. A riveting and nuanced investigation into racial politics and for-profit health care in the United States, The Kissing Bug reveals the intimate history of a marginalized disease and connects us to the lives at the center of it all.</p></div>", "isbn": "9781953534194", "path": "Daisy Hernandez/The Kissing Bug (148)", "has_cover": 1, "flags": 1, "author_ids": ["151"], "series_ids": null, "publisher_ids": ["89"], "language_ids": ["1"], "tag_ids": ["92", "121", "138", "139", "194"], "identifier_ids": ["359", "361", "360"], "order_by": "2022-10-05 15:54:16.610501+00:00", "authors": [{"id": 151, "name": "Daisy Hern\u00e1ndez", "count": 1, "avg_rating": 8.0, "sort": "Hern\u00e1ndez, Daisy"}], "publishers": [{"id": 89, "name": "Tin House Books, LLC", "count": 2, "avg_rating": 8.0, "sort": "Tin House Books, LLC"}], "languages": [{"id": 1, "name": "ENG", "count": 448, "avg_rating": 8.366795366795367, "sort": "ENG"}], "tags": [{"id": 194, "name": "Time", "count": 40, "avg_rating": 8.333333333333334, "sort": 40}, {"id": 92, "name": "Biography", "count": 32, "avg_rating": 8.214285714285714, "sort": 32}, {"id": 121, "name": "Social Science", "count": 6, "avg_rating": 9.6, "sort": 6}, {"id": 138, "name": "Medical", "count": 3, "avg_rating": 8.0, "sort": 3}, {"id": 139, "name": "Disease & Health Issues", "count": 2, "avg_rating": 8.0, "sort": 2}], "identifiers": [{"id": 360, "book": 148, "type": "isbn", "val": "9781953534194", "sort": "isbn", "name": "ISBN", "path": "https://www.worldcat.org/isbn/9781953534194"}, {"id": 361, "book": 148, "type": "google", "val": "xC-3zgEACAAJ", "sort": "google", "name": "Google Books", "path": "https://books.google.com/books?id=xC-3zgEACAAJ"}, {"id": 359, "book": 148, "type": "goodreads", "val": "61268043", "sort": "goodreads", "name": "Goodreads", "path": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/61268043"}], "custom_types": "eBook", "custom_reading_list": 0, "custom_read_date": null, "custom_lists": [{"id": 5, "value": "Must Read.2021 Time", "sort": "Must Read.2021 Time"}], "custom_lists_ids": ["5"], "custom_clean": 1}, {"id": 147, "title": "Real Estate", "rating": 4, "timestamp": "2022-10-05 15:54:16.235504+00:00", "pubdate": "2021-05-13", "last_modified": "2025-05-29 14:22:59.457405+00:00", "size": 961222, "comments": "<div>\n<p>From one of the great thinkers and writers of our time, comes the highly anticipated final instalment in Deborah Levy's critically acclaimed 'Living Autobiography'<br>'I can't think of any writer aside from Virginia Woolf who writes better about what it is to be a woman' Observer on The Cost of Living</p>\n<p>Following the international critical acclaim of The Cost of Living , this final volume of Deborah Levy's 'Living Autobiography' is an exhilarating, thought-provoking and boldly intimate meditation on home and the spectres that haunt it.</p>\n<p>'I began to wonder what myself and all unwritten and unseen women would possess in their property portfolios at the end of their lives.

Sullivan, Jr., Washington Post From one of our top historians, a groundbreaking story of policing and \u201criots\u201d that shatters our understanding of the post\u2013civil rights era. What began in spring 2020 as local protests in response to the killing of George Floyd by Minneapolis police quickly exploded into a massive nationwide movement. Millions of mostly young people defiantly flooded into the nation\u2019s streets, demanding an end to police brutality and to the broader, systemic repression of Black people and other people of color. To many observers, the protests appeared to be without precedent in their scale and persistence. Yet, as the acclaimed historian Elizabeth Hinton demonstrates in America on Fire, the events of 2020 had clear precursors\u2014and any attempt to understand our current crisis requires a reckoning with the recent past. Even in the aftermath of Donald Trump, many Americans consider the decades since the civil rights movement in the mid-1960s as a story of progress toward greater inclusiveness and equality. Hinton\u2019s sweeping narrative uncovers an altogether different history, taking us on a troubling journey from Detroit in 1967 and Miami in 1980 to Los Angeles in 1992 and beyond to chart the persistence of structural racism and one of its primary consequences, the so-called urban riot. Hinton offers a critical corrective: the word riot was nothing less than a racist trope applied to events that can only be properly understood as rebellions\u2014explosions of collective resistance to an unequal and violent order. As she suggests, if rebellion and the conditions that precipitated it never disappeared, the optimistic story of a post\u2013Jim Crow United States no longer holds. Black rebellion, America on Fire powerfully illustrates, was born in response to poverty and exclusion, but most immediately in reaction to police violence. In 1968, President Lyndon Johnson launched the \u201cWar on Crime,\u201d sending militarized police forces into impoverished Black neighborhoods. Facing increasing surveillance and brutality, residents threw rocks and Molotov cocktails at officers, plundered local businesses, and vandalized exploitative institutions. Hinton draws on exclusive sources to uncover a previously hidden geography of violence in smaller American cities, from York, Pennsylvania, to Cairo, Illinois, to Stockton, California. The central lesson from these eruptions\u2014that police violence invariably leads to community violence\u2014continues to escape policymakers, who respond by further criminalizing entire groups instead of addressing underlying socioeconomic causes. The results are the hugely expanded policing and prison regimes that shape the lives of so many Americans today. Presenting a new framework for understanding our nation\u2019s enduring strife, America on Fire is also a warning: rebellions will surely continue unless police are no longer called on to manage the consequences of dismal conditions beyond their control, and until an oppressive system is finally remade on the principles of justice and equality.</p></div>", "isbn": "9781631498916", "path": "Elizabeth Hinton/America on Fire_ The Untold History (144)", "has_cover": 1, "flags": 1, "author_ids": ["146"], "series_ids": null, "publisher_ids": ["84"], "language_ids": ["1"], "tag_ids": ["57", "60", "194"], "identifier_ids": ["351", "352", "353"], "order_by": "2022-10-05 15:54:15.142378+00:00", "authors": [{"id": 146, "name": "Elizabeth Hinton", "count": 1, "avg_rating": 8.0, "sort": "Hinton, Elizabeth"}], "publishers": [{"id": 84, "name": "Liveright Publishing", "count": 4, "avg_rating": 8.0, "sort": "Liveright Publishing"}], "languages": [{"id": 1, "name": "ENG", "count": 448, "avg_rating": 8.366795366795367, "sort": "ENG"}], "tags": [{"id": 194, "name": "Time", "count": 40, "avg_rating": 8.333333333333334, "sort": 40}, {"id": 60, "name": "History", "count": 27, "avg_rating": 8.416666666666666, "sort": 27}, {"id": 57, "name": "Politics", "count": 24, "avg_rating": 8.416666666666666, "sort": 24}], "identifiers": [{"id": 353, "book": 144, "type": "isbn", "val": "9781631498916", "sort": "isbn", "name": "ISBN", "path": "https://www.worldcat.org/isbn/9781631498916"}, {"id": 352, "book": 144, "type": "google", "val": "PAwDEAAAQBAJ", "sort": "google", "name": "Google Books", "path": "https://books.google.com/books?id=PAwDEAAAQBAJ"}, {"id": 351, "book": 144, "type": "goodreads", "val": "55298326", "sort": "goodreads", "name": "Goodreads", "path": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/55298326"}], "custom_types": "eBook", "custom_reading_list": 0, "custom_read_date": null, "custom_lists": [{"id": 5, "value": "Must Read.2021 Time", "sort": "Must Read.2021 Time"}], "custom_lists_ids": ["5"], "custom_clean": 1}, {"id": 143, "title": "Under a White Sky: The Nature of the Future", "rating": 4, "timestamp": "2022-10-05 15:54:14.761371+00:00", "pubdate": "2021-02-09", "last_modified": "2025-05-29 14:22:59.457405+00:00", "size": 4317039, "comments": "<div>\n<p>NATIONAL BESTSELLER * The Pulitzer Prize-winning author of The Sixth Extinction returns to humanity's transformative impact on the environment, now asking: After doing so much damage, can we change nature, this time to save it?

So pervasive are human impacts on the planet that it's said we live in a new geological epoch: the Anthropocene. In Under a White Sky, Elizabeth Kolbert takes a hard look at the new world we are creating. Along the way, she meets biologists who are trying to preserve the world's rarest fish, which lives in a single tiny pool in the middle of the Mojave; engineers who are turning carbon emissions to stone in Iceland; Australian researchers who are trying to develop a \"super coral\" that can survive on a hotter globe; and physicists who are contemplating shooting tiny diamonds into the stratosphere to cool the earth. One way to look at human civilization, says Kolbert, is as a ten-thousand-year exercise in defying nature. In The Sixth Extinction, she explored the ways in which our capacity for destruction has reshaped the natural world. Now she examines how the very sorts of interventions that have imperiled our planet are increasingly seen as the only hope for its salvation. By turns inspiring, terrifying, and darkly comic, Under a White Sky is an utterly original examination of the challenges we face.</p></div>", "isbn": "9780593136287", "path": "Elizabeth Kolbert/Under a White Sky_ The Nature of th (143)", "has_cover": 1, "flags": 1, "author_ids": ["145"], "series_ids": null, "publisher_ids": ["100"], "language_ids": ["1"], "tag_ids": ["57", "58", "60", "125", "194", "253"], "identifier_ids": ["462", "461", "460", "459"], "order_by": "2022-10-05 15:54:14.761371+00:00", "authors": [{"id": 145, "name": "Elizabeth Kolbert", "count": 1, "avg_rating": 8.0, "sort": "Kolbert, Elizabeth"}], "publishers": [{"id": 100, "name": "Crown Publishing Group", "count": 7, "avg_rating": 8.0, "sort": "Crown Publishing Group"}], "languages": [{"id": 1, "name": "ENG", "count": 448, "avg_rating": 8.366795366795367, "sort": "ENG"}], "tags": [{"id": 194, "name": "Time", "count": 40, "avg_rating": 8.333333333333334, "sort": 40}, {"id": 60, "name": "History", "count": 27, "avg_rating": 8.416666666666666, "sort": 27}, {"id": 57, "name": "Politics", "count": 24, "avg_rating": 8.416666666666666, "sort": 24}, {"id": 58, "name": "Science", "count": 19, "avg_rating": 8.125, "sort": 19}, {"id": 253, "name": "Non-Fiction", "count": 3, "avg_rating": 8.0, "sort": 3}, {"id": 125, "name": "Climate Crisis", "count": 1, "avg_rating": 8.0, "sort": 1}], "identifiers": [{"id": 459, "book": 143, "type": "isbn", "val": "9780593136287", "sort": "isbn", "name": "ISBN", "path": "https://www.worldcat.org/isbn/9780593136287"}, {"id": 460, "book": 143, "type": "google", "val": "qwpjEAAAQBAJ", "sort": "google", "name": "Google Books", "path": "https://books.google.com/books?id=qwpjEAAAQBAJ"}, {"id": 461, "book": 143, "type": "goodreads", "val": "60757903", "sort": "goodreads", "name": "Goodreads", "path": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/60757903"}, {"id": 462, "book": 143, "type": "amazon", "val": "B08DMWR6BP", "sort": "amazon", "name": "Amazon", "path": "https://amazon.com/dp/B08DMWR6BP"}], "custom_types": "eBook", "custom_reading_list": 0, "custom_read_date": null, "custom_lists": [{"id": 5, "value": "Must Read.2021 Time", "sort": "Must Read.2021 Time"}], "custom_lists_ids": ["5"], "custom_clean": 1}, {"id": 142, "title": "Who They Was", "rating": 4, "timestamp": "2022-10-05 15:54:14.383381+00:00", "pubdate": "2020-09-03", "last_modified": "2025-05-29 14:22:59.457405+00:00", "size": 1010714, "comments": "<div>\n<p>Longlisted for the Booker Prize 2020 A Spectator Book of the Year 'A literary rendering of the Top Boy generation...

Married to three brothers in a single ceremony, she and her now-sisters spend their days hard at work in the family's \"china room,\" sequestered from contact with the men--except when their domineering mother-in-law, Mai, summons them to a darkened chamber at night. Curious and strong willed, Mehar tries to piece together what Mai doesn't want her to know. From beneath her veil, she studies the sounds of the men's voices, the calluses on their fingers as she serves them tea. Soon she glimpses something that seems to confirm which of the brothers is her husband, and a series of events is set in motion that will put more than one life at risk. As the early stirrings of the Indian independence movement rise around her, Mehar must weigh her own desires against the reality--and danger--of her situation.</p>\n<p>Spiraling around Mehar's story is that of a young man who arrives at his uncle's house in Punjab in the summer of 1999, hoping to shake an addiction that has held him in its grip for more than two years. Growing up in small-town England as the son of an immigrant shopkeeper, his experiences of racism, violence, and estrangement from the culture of his birth led him to seek a dangerous form of escape. As he rides out his withdrawal at his family's ancestral home--an abandoned farmstead, its china room mysteriously locked and barred--he begins to knit himself back together, gathering strength for the journey home.</p>\n<p>Partly inspired by award-winning author Sunjeev Sahota's family history, China Room is at once a deft exploration of how systems of power circumscribe individual lives and a deeply moving portrait of the unconquerable human capacity to resist them.

Nobody, including the lawmakers who passed the bill, expected it to transform the country\u2019s demographics. But over the next four decades, millions arrived, including Jay Caspian Kang\u2019s parents, grandparents, aunts, and uncles. They came with almost no understanding of their new home, much less the history of \u201cAsian America\u201d that was supposed to define them.\u00a0The Loneliest Americans is the unforgettable story of Kang and his family as they move from a housing project in Cambridge to an idyllic college town in the South and eventually to the West Coast. Their story unfolds against the backdrop of a rapidly expanding Asian America, as millions more immigrants, many of them working-class or undocumented, stream into the country.

She worried constantly about her parents dying -- especially her mother.

With a distinct voice that is wry and heartfelt, Kat weaves together what is part ghost story and part excavation of her family's history of loss spanning three generations and their immigration from China and Hong Kong to America and Cuba. This redemptive coming-of-age story uncovers the uncanny parallels in Kat's lineage, including the strength of sisterhood and the complicated duty of looking after parents, even after death.</p>\n<p>Seeing Ghosts asks what it means to claim and tell your family's story: Is writing an exorcism or is it its own form of preservation? What do we owe to our families in our grief, and how does it shape us? In order to answer these questions and to understand her family's ghosts, Kat unearths their sorrow and challenges the power structures of race, class, and gender.

Pop Song is a book about love and about falling in love\u2014with a place, or a painting, or a person\u2014and the joy and terror inherent in the experience of that love. Plumbing the well of culture for clues and patterns about love and loss\u2014from Agnes Martin's abstract paintings to James Turrell's transcendent light works, and Anne Carson's Eros the Bittersweet to Frank Ocean's Blonde\u2014Pham writes of her youthful attempts to find meaning in travel, sex, drugs, and art, before sensing that she might need to turn her gaze upon herself. Pop Song is also a book about distances, near and far. As she travels from Taos, New Mexico, to Shanghai, China and beyond, Pham meditates on the miles we are willing to cover to get away from ourselves, or those who hurt us, and the impossible gaps that can exist between two people sharing a bed. Pop Song is a book about all the routes by which we might escape our own needs before finally finding a way home. There is heartache in these pages, but Pham's electric ways of seeing create a perfectly fractured portrait of modern intimacy that is triumphant in both its vulnerability and restlessness. \"Each of the essays in this debut collection reads like a mini-memoir ... in which the author reflects on her experiences of young love, trauma, and transcendence through discussions of art and music ... with an intimacy that is at once tender and expansive.</p>\n<p>\" \u2014New York magazine</p></div>", "isbn": "9781646220274", "path": "Larissa Pham/Pop Song_ Adventures in Art & Intim (133)", "has_cover": 1, "flags": 1, "author_ids": ["135"], "series_ids": null, "publisher_ids": ["77"], "language_ids": ["1"], "tag_ids": ["44", "49", "92", "132", "133", "194"], "identifier_ids": ["320", "318", "319"], "order_by": "2022-10-05 15:54:11.131714+00:00", "authors": [{"id": 135, "name": "Larissa Pham", "count": 1, "avg_rating": 8.0, "sort": "Pham, Larissa"}], "publishers": [{"id": 77, "name": "Catapult", "count": 1, "avg_rating": 8.0, "sort": "Catapult"}], "languages": [{"id": 1, "name": "ENG", "count": 448, "avg_rating": 8.366795366795367, "sort": "ENG"}], "tags": [{"id": 49, "name": "Contemporary", "count": 61, "avg_rating": 8.8125, "sort": 61}, {"id": 194, "name": "Time", "count": 40, "avg_rating": 8.333333333333334, "sort": 40}, {"id": 92, "name": "Biography", "count": 32, "avg_rating": 8.214285714285714, "sort": 32}, {"id": 44, "name": "Art", "count": 8, "avg_rating": 8.125, "sort": 8}, {"id": 132, "name": "Music", "count": 6, "avg_rating": 7.6, "sort": 6}, {"id": 133, "name": "Feminism", "count": 6, "avg_rating": 8.333333333333334, "sort": 6}], "identifiers": [{"id": 319, "book": 133, "type": "isbn", "val": "9781646220274", "sort": "isbn", "name": "ISBN", "path": "https://www.worldcat.org/isbn/9781646220274"}, {"id": 318, "book": 133, "type": "google", "val": "V6UQEAAAQBAJ", "sort": "google", "name": "Google Books", "path": "https://books.google.com/books?id=V6UQEAAAQBAJ"}, {"id": 320, "book": 133, "type": "goodreads", "val": "60057391", "sort": "goodreads", "name": "Goodreads", "path": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/60057391"}], "custom_types": "eBook", "custom_reading_list": 0, "custom_read_date": null, "custom_lists": [{"id": 5, "value": "Must Read.2021 Time", "sort": "Must Read.2021 Time"}], "custom_lists_ids": ["5"], "custom_clean": 1}, {"id": 132, "title": "The Free World: Art and Thought in the Cold War", "rating": 4, "timestamp": "2022-10-05 15:54:10.771659+00:00", "pubdate": "2021-04-20", "last_modified": "2025-05-29 14:22:59.457405+00:00", "size": 35444855, "comments": "<div>\n<p>\"An engrossing and impossibly wide-ranging project ...

It was also about ideas, in the broadest sense\u2014economic and political, artistic and personal. In The Free World, the acclaimed Pulitzer Prize\u2013winning scholar and critic Louis Menand tells the story of American culture in the pivotal years from the end of World War II to Vietnam and shows how changing economic, technological, and social forces put their mark on creations of the mind. How did elitism and an anti-totalitarian skepticism of passion and ideology give way to a new sensibility defined by freewheeling experimentation and loving the Beatles? How was the ideal of \u201cfreedom\u201d applied to causes that ranged from anti-communism and civil rights to radical acts of self-creation via art and even crime? With the wit and insight familiar to readers of The Metaphysical Club and his New Yorker essays, Menand takes us inside Hannah Arendt\u2019s Manhattan, the Paris of Jean-Paul Sartre and Simone de Beauvoir, Merce Cunningham and John Cage\u2019s residencies at North Carolina\u2019s Black Mountain College, and the Memphis studio where Sam Phillips and Elvis Presley created a new music for the American teenager. He examines the post war vogue for French existentialism, structuralism and post-structuralism, the rise of abstract expressionism and pop art, Allen Ginsberg\u2019s friendship with Lionel Trilling, James Baldwin\u2019s transformation into a Civil Right spokesman, Susan Sontag\u2019s challenges to the New York Intellectuals, the defeat of obscenity laws, and the rise of the New Hollywood. Stressing the rich flow of ideas across the Atlantic, he also shows how Europeans played a vital role in promoting and influencing American art and entertainment. By the end of the Vietnam era, the American government had lost the moral prestige it enjoyed at the end of the Second World War, but America\u2019s once-despised culture had become respected and adored.

Next he directed four consecutive hit plays, won back-to-back Tonys, ushered in a new era of Hollywood moviemaking with Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?, and followed it with The Graduate, which won him an Oscar and became the third-highest-grossing movie ever. At thirty-five, he lived in a three-story Central Park West penthouse, drove a Rolls-Royce, collected Arabian horses, and counted Jacqueline Kennedy, Elizabeth Taylor, Leonard Bernstein, and Richard Avedon as friends.</p>\n<p>Where he arrived is even more astonishing given where he had begun: born Igor Peschkowsky to a Jewish couple in Berlin in 1931, he was sent along with his younger brother to America on a ship in 1939. The young immigrant boy caught very few breaks. He was bullied and ostracized--an allergic reaction had rendered him permanently hairless--and his father died when he was just twelve, leaving his mother alone and overwhelmed.</p>\n<p>The gulf between these two sets of facts explains a great deal about Nichols's transformation from lonely outsider to the center of more than one cultural universe--the acute powers of observation that first made him famous; the nourishment he drew from his creative partnerships, most enduringly with May; his unquenchable drive; his hunger for security and status; and the depressions and self-medications that brought him to terrible lows. It would take decades for him to come to grips with his demons. In an incomparable portrait that follows Nichols from Berlin to New York to Chicago to Hollywood, Mark Harris explores, with brilliantly vivid detail and insight, the life, work, struggle, and passion of an artist and man in constant motion. Among the 250 people Harris interviewed: Elaine May, Meryl Streep, Stephen Sondheim, Robert Redford, Glenn Close, Tom Hanks, Candice Bergen, Emma Thompson, Annette Bening, Natalie Portman, Julia Roberts, Lorne Michaels, and Gloria Steinem.</p>\n<p>Mark Harris gives an intimate and evenhanded accounting of success and failure alike; the portrait is not always flattering, but its ultimate impact is to present the full story of one of the most richly interesting, complicated, and consequential figures the worlds of theater and motion pictures have ever seen. It is a triumph of the biographer's art.</p></div>", "isbn": "9780399562259", "path": "Mark Harris/Mike Nichols_ A Life (130)", "has_cover": 1, "flags": 1, "author_ids": ["132"], "series_ids": null, "publisher_ids": ["90"], "language_ids": ["1"], "tag_ids": ["44", "60", "92", "194"], "identifier_ids": ["309", "307", "308"], "order_by": "2022-10-05 15:54:10.022661+00:00", "authors": [{"id": 132, "name": "Mark Harris", "count": 1, "avg_rating": 8.0, "sort": "Harris, Mark"}], "publishers": [{"id": 90, "name": "Penguin Random House", "count": 21, "avg_rating": 8.75, "sort": "Penguin Random House"}], "languages": [{"id": 1, "name": "ENG", "count": 448, "avg_rating": 8.366795366795367, "sort": "ENG"}], "tags": [{"id": 194, "name": "Time", "count": 40, "avg_rating": 8.333333333333334, "sort": 40}, {"id": 92, "name": "Biography", "count": 32, "avg_rating": 8.214285714285714, "sort": 32}, {"id": 60, "name": "History", "count": 27, "avg_rating": 8.416666666666666, "sort": 27}, {"id": 44, "name": "Art", "count": 8, "avg_rating": 8.125, "sort": 8}], "identifiers": [{"id": 308, "book": 130, "type": "isbn", "val": "9780399562259", "sort": "isbn", "name": "ISBN", "path": "https://www.worldcat.org/isbn/9780399562259"}, {"id": 307, "book": 130, "type": "google", "val": "DQTlDwAAQBAJ", "sort": "google", "name": "Google Books", "path": "https://books.google.com/books?id=DQTlDwAAQBAJ"}, {"id": 309, "book": 130, "type": "goodreads", "val": "53479533", "sort": "goodreads", "name": "Goodreads", "path": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/53479533"}], "custom_types": "eBook", "custom_reading_list": 0, "custom_read_date": null, "custom_lists": [{"id": 5, "value": "Must Read.2021 Time", "sort": "Must Read.2021 Time"}], "custom_lists_ids": ["5"], "custom_clean": 1}, {"id": 129, "title": "1000 Years of Joys and Sorrows: A Memoir", "rating": 4, "timestamp": "2022-10-05 15:54:09.684578+00:00", "pubdate": "2021-11-02", "last_modified": "2025-05-29 14:22:59.457405+00:00", "size": 51807772, "comments": "<div>\n<p>Once an intimate of Mao Zedong and the nation's most celebrated poet, Ai Weiwei's father, Ai Qing, was branded a rightist during the Cultural Revolution, and he and his family were banished to a desolate place known as \"Little Siberia,\" where Ai Qing was sentenced to hard labor cleaning public toilets.

Though virtually forgotten today, this act of brutality set into motion a remarkable series of criminal investigations and cross-cultural negotiations that challenged the definition of justice in early America.</p>\n<p>In Covered with Night , leading historian Nicole Eustace reconstructs the crime and its aftermath, bringing us into the overlapping worlds of white colonists and Indigenous peoples in this formative period. As she shows, the murder of the Indigenous man set the entire mid-Atlantic on edge, with many believing war was imminent. Isolated killings often flared into colonial wars in North America, and colonists now anticipated a vengeful Indigenous uprising. Frantic efforts to resolve the case ignited a dramatic, far-reaching debate between Native American forms of justice\u2014centered on community, forgiveness, and reparations\u2014and an ideology of harsh reprisal, unique to the colonies and based on British law, which called for the killers\u2019 swift execution.</p>\n<p>In charting the far-reaching ramifications of the murder, Covered with Night \u2014a phrase from Iroquois mourning practices\u2014overturns persistent assumptions about \u201ccivilized\u201d Europeans and \u201csavage\u201d Native Americans. As Eustace powerfully contends, the colonial obsession with \u201ccivility\u201d belied the reality that the Iroquois, far from being the barbarians of the white imagination, acted under a mantle of sophistication and humanity as they tried to make the land- and power-hungry colonials understand their ways. In truth, Eustace reveals, the Iroquois\u2014the Six Nations of the Haudenosaunee, as they are known today\u2014saw the killing as an opportunity to forge stronger bonds with the colonists. They argued for restorative justice and for reconciliation between the two sides, even as they mourned the deceased.</p>\n<p>An absorbing chronicle built around an extraordinary group of characters\u2014from the slain man\u2019s resilient widow to the Indigenous diplomat known as \u201cCaptain Civility\u201d to the scheming governor of Pennsylvania\u2014 Covered with Night transforms a single event into an unforgettable portrait of early America.

From the prize-winning and bestselling author of Say Nothing The history of the Sackler dynasty is rife with drama\u2014baroque personal lives; bitter disputes over estates; fistfights in boardrooms; glittering art collections; Machiavellian courtroom maneuvers; and the calculated use of money to burnish reputations and crush the less powerful.\u00a0The Sackler name has adorned the walls of many storied institutions\u2014Harvard, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Oxford, the Louvre. They are one of the richest families in the world, known for their lavish donations to the arts and the sciences. The source of the family fortune was vague, however, until it emerged that the Sacklers were responsible for making and marketing a blockbuster painkiller that was the catalyst for the opioid crisis. Empire of Pain begins with the story of three doctor brothers, Raymond, Mortimer and the incalculably energetic Arthur, who weathered the poverty of the Great Depression and appalling anti-Semitism. Working at a barbaric mental institution, Arthur saw a better way and conducted groundbreaking research into drug treatments. He also had a genius for marketing, especially for pharmaceuticals, and bought a small ad firm.</p>\n<p>Arthur devised the marketing for Valium, and built the first great Sackler fortune. He purchased a drug manufacturer, Purdue Frederick, which would be run by Raymond and Mortimer. The brothers began collecting art, and wives, and grand residences in exotic locales. Their children and grandchildren grew up in luxury.</p>\n<p>Forty years later, Raymond\u2019s son Richard ran the family-owned Purdue. The template Arthur Sackler created to sell Valium\u2014co-opting doctors, influencing the FDA, downplaying the drug\u2019s addictiveness\u2014was employed to launch a far more potent product: OxyContin. The drug went on to generate some thirty-five billion dollars in revenue, and to launch a public health crisis in which hundreds of thousands would die. This is the saga of three generations of a single family and the mark they would leave on the world, a tale that moves from the bustling streets of early twentieth-century Brooklyn to the seaside palaces\u00a0of Greenwich, Connecticut, and Cap d\u2019Antibes to the corridors of power in Washington, D.C.\u00a0 Empire of Pain chronicles the multiple investigations of the Sacklers and their company, and the scorched-earth legal tactics that the family has used to evade accountability.\u00a0Empire of Pain is a masterpiece of narrative reporting and writing, exhaustively documented and ferociously compelling. It is a portrait of the excesses of America\u2019s second Gilded Age, a study of impunity among the super elite and a relentless investigation of the naked greed and indifference to human suffering that built one of the world\u2019s great fortunes.</p></div>", "isbn": "9780385545693", "path": "Patrick Radden Keefe/Empire of Pain_ The Secret History (124)", "has_cover": 1, "flags": 1, "author_ids": ["126"], "series_ids": null, "publisher_ids": ["82"], "language_ids": ["1"], "tag_ids": ["51", "57", "58", "60", "92", "194"], "identifier_ids": ["408", "406", "407"], "order_by": "2022-10-05 15:54:07.602947+00:00", "authors": [{"id": 126, "name": "Patrick Radden Keefe", "count": 1, "avg_rating": 10.0, "sort": "Keefe, Patrick Radden"}], "publishers": [{"id": 82, "name": "Knopf Publishing Group", "count": 5, "avg_rating": 8.5, "sort": "Knopf Publishing Group"}], "languages": [{"id": 1, "name": "ENG", "count": 448, "avg_rating": 8.366795366795367, "sort": "ENG"}], "tags": [{"id": 194, "name": "Time", "count": 40, "avg_rating": 8.333333333333334, "sort": 40}, {"id": 92, "name": "Biography", "count": 32, "avg_rating": 8.214285714285714, "sort": 32}, {"id": 60, "name": "History", "count": 27, "avg_rating": 8.416666666666666, "sort": 27}, {"id": 57, "name": "Politics", "count": 24, "avg_rating": 8.416666666666666, "sort": 24}, {"id": 51, "name": "Business", "count": 23, "avg_rating": 8.272727272727273, "sort": 23}, {"id": 58, "name": "Science", "count": 19, "avg_rating": 8.125, "sort": 19}], "identifiers": [{"id": 407, "book": 124, "type": "isbn", "val": "9780385545693", "sort": "isbn", "name": "ISBN", "path": "https://www.worldcat.org/isbn/9780385545693"}, {"id": 406, "book": 124, "type": "google", "val": "Qb4IEAAAQBAJ", "sort": "google", "name": "Google Books", "path": "https://books.google.com/books?id=Qb4IEAAAQBAJ"}, {"id": 408, "book": 124, "type": "goodreads", "val": "43868109", "sort": "goodreads", "name": "Goodreads", "path": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43868109"}], "custom_types": "eBook", "custom_reading_list": 0, "custom_read_date": null, "custom_lists": [{"id": 5, "value": "Must Read.2021 Time", "sort": "Must Read.2021 Time"}], "custom_lists_ids": ["5"], "custom_clean": 1}, {"id": 123, "title": "The Committed", "rating": 4, "timestamp": "2022-10-05 15:54:07.284827+00:00", "pubdate": "2021-03-02", "last_modified": "2025-05-29 14:22:59.457405+00:00", "size": 2249337, "comments": "<div>\n<p>The sequel to The Sympathizer, which won the 2016 Pulitzer Prize in Fiction and went on to sell over a million copies worldwide, The Committed tells the story of \u201cthe man of two minds\u201d as he comes as a refugee to France and turns his hand to capitalism</p>\n<p>The long-awaited follow-up to the Pulitzer Prize-winning The Sympathizer, which has sold more than one million copies worldwide, The Committed follows the man of two minds as he arrives in Paris in the early 1980s with his blood brother Bon.

Soon after, the nine-year-old girl was separated from her mother and sold.</p>\n<p>Decades later, Ashley\u2019s granddaughter Ruth embroidered this family history on the bag in spare yet haunting language\u2014including Rose\u2019s wish that \u201cIt be filled with my Love always.\u201d Ruth\u2019s sewn words, the reason we remember Ashley\u2019s sack today, evoke a sweeping family story of loss and of love passed down through generations. Now, in this illuminating, deeply moving book inspired by Rose\u2019s gift to Ashley, historian Tiya Miles carefully unearths these women\u2019s faint presence in archival records to follow the paths of their lives\u2014and the lives of so many women like them\u2014to write a singular and revelatory history of the experience of slavery, and the uncertain freedom afterward, in the United States.</p>\n<p>The search to uncover this history is part of the story itself. For where the historical record falls short of capturing Rose\u2019s, Ashley\u2019s, and Ruth\u2019s full lives, Miles turns to objects and to art as equally important sources, assembling a chorus of women\u2019s and families\u2019 stories and critiquing the scant archives that for decades have overlooked so many. The contents of Ashley\u2019s sack\u2014a tattered dress, handfuls of pecans, a braid of hair, \u201cmy Love always\u201d\u2014are eloquent evidence of the lives these women lived. As she follows Ashley\u2019s journey, Miles metaphorically unpacks the bag, deepening its emotional resonance and exploring the meanings and significance of everything it contained.</p>\n<p>All That She Carried is a poignant story of resilience and of love passed down through generations of women against steep odds. It honors the creativity and fierce resourcefulness of people who preserved family ties even when official systems refused to do so, and it serves as a visionary illustration of how to reconstruct and recount their stories today.</p></div>", "isbn": "9781984854995", "path": "Tiya Miles/All That She Carried_ The Journey o (120)", "has_cover": 1, "flags": 1, "author_ids": ["122"], "series_ids": null, "publisher_ids": ["90"], "language_ids": ["1"], "tag_ids": ["194"], "identifier_ids": ["586", "587"], "order_by": "2022-10-05 15:54:06.021573+00:00", "authors": [{"id": 122, "name": "Tiya Miles", "count": 1, "avg_rating": 8.0, "sort": "Miles, Tiya"}], "publishers": [{"id": 90, "name": "Penguin Random House", "count": 21, "avg_rating": 8.75, "sort": "Penguin Random House"}], "languages": [{"id": 1, "name": "ENG", "count": 448, "avg_rating": 8.366795366795367, "sort": "ENG"}], "tags": [{"id": 194, "name": "Time", "count": 40, "avg_rating": 8.333333333333334, "sort": 40}], "identifiers": [{"id": 587, "book": 120, "type": "isbn", "val": "9781984854995", "sort": "isbn", "name": "ISBN", "path": "https://www.worldcat.org/isbn/9781984854995"}, {"id": 586, "book": 120, "type": "amazon", "val": "1984854992", "sort": "amazon", "name": "Amazon", "path": "https://amazon.com/dp/1984854992"}], "custom_types": "eBook", "custom_reading_list": 0, "custom_read_date": null, "custom_lists": [{"id": 5, "value": "Must Read.2021 Time", "sort": "Must Read.2021 Time"}], "custom_lists_ids": ["5"], "custom_clean": 1}, {"id": 119, "title": "The Copenhagen Trilogy: Childhood; Youth; Dependency", "rating": 4, "timestamp": "2022-10-05 15:54:05.695418+00:00", "pubdate": "1967-01-01", "last_modified": "2025-05-29 14:22:59.457405+00:00", "size": 697307, "comments": "<div>\n<p>Tove Ditlevsen is today celebrated as one of the most important and unique voices in twentieth-century Danish literature, and The Copenhagen Trilogy (1969-71) is her acknowledged masterpiece.

Dependency picks up the story as the narrator embarks on the first of her four marriages and goes on to describe her horrible descent into drug addiction, enabled by her sinister, gaslighting doctor-husband.</p>\n<p>Throughout, the narrator grapples with the tension between her vocation as a writer and her competing roles as daughter, wife, mother, and drug addict, and she writes about female experience and identity in a way that feels very fresh and pertinent to today's discussions around feminism. Ditlevsen's trilogy is remarkable for its intensity and its immersive depiction of a world of complex female friendships, family and growing up--in this sense, it's Copenhagen's answer to Elena Ferrante's Neapolitan Novels. She can also be seen as a spiritual forerunner of confessional writers like Karl Ove Knausgaard, Annie Ernaux, Rachel Cusk and Deborah Levy.

Beginning in his hometown of New Orleans, Clint Smith leads the reader on an unforgettable tour of monuments and landmarks--those that are honest about the past and those that are not--that offer an intergenerational story of how slavery has been central in shaping our nation's collective history, and ourselves. It is the story of the Monticello Plantation in Virginia, the estate where Thomas Jefferson wrote letters espousing the urgent need for liberty while enslaving more than four hundred people. It is the story of the Whitney Plantation, one of the only former plantations devoted to preserving the experience of the enslaved people whose lives and work sustained it. It is the story of Angola, a former plantation-turned-maximum-security prison in Louisiana that is filled with Black men who work across the 18,000-acre land for virtually no pay. And it is the story of Blandford Cemetery, the final resting place of tens of thousands of Confederate soldiers. A deeply researched and transporting exploration of the legacy of slavery and its imprint on centuries of American history, How the Word Is Passed illustrates how some of our country's most essential stories are hidden in plain view--whether in places we might drive by on our way to work, holidays such as Juneteenth, or entire neighborhoods like downtown Manhattan, where the brutal history of the trade in enslaved men, women, and children has been deeply imprinted. Informed by scholarship and brought to life by the story of people living today, Smith's debut work of nonfiction is a landmark of reflection and insight that offers a new understanding of the hopeful role that memory and history can play in making sense of our country and how it has come to be.</p></div>", "isbn": "9780316492935", "path": "Clint Smith/How the Word Is Passed_ A Reckoning (113)", "has_cover": 1, "flags": 1, "author_ids": ["115"], "series_ids": null, "publisher_ids": ["219"], "language_ids": ["1"], "tag_ids": ["57", "60", "194"], "identifier_ids": ["374", "376", "375", "377"], "order_by": "2022-10-05 15:54:03.677102+00:00", "authors": [{"id": 115, "name": "Clint Smith", "count": 1, "avg_rating": 10.0, "sort": "Smith, Clint"}], "publishers": [{"id": 219, "name": "Little Brown and Company", "count": 5, "avg_rating": 8.4, "sort": "Little Brown and Company"}], "languages": [{"id": 1, "name": "ENG", "count": 448, "avg_rating": 8.366795366795367, "sort": "ENG"}], "tags": [{"id": 194, "name": "Time", "count": 40, "avg_rating": 8.333333333333334, "sort": 40}, {"id": 60, "name": "History", "count": 27, "avg_rating": 8.416666666666666, "sort": 27}, {"id": 57, "name": "Politics", "count": 24, "avg_rating": 8.416666666666666, "sort": 24}], "identifiers": [{"id": 377, "book": 113, "type": "isbn", "val": "9780316492935", "sort": "isbn", "name": "ISBN", "path": "https://www.worldcat.org/isbn/9780316492935"}, {"id": 375, "book": 113, "type": "google", "val": "8pEHzgEACAAJ", "sort": "google", "name": "Google Books", "path": "https://books.google.com/books?id=8pEHzgEACAAJ"}, {"id": 376, "book": 113, "type": "goodreads", "val": "55643287", "sort": "goodreads", "name": "Goodreads", "path": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/55643287"}, {"id": 374, "book": 113, "type": "amazon", "val": "0316492930", "sort": "amazon", "name": "Amazon", "path": "https://amazon.com/dp/0316492930"}], "custom_types": "eBook", "custom_reading_list": 0, "custom_read_date": null, "custom_lists": [{"id": 5, "value": "Must Read.2021 Time", "sort": "Must Read.2021 Time"}], "custom_lists_ids": ["5"], "custom_clean": 1}, {"id": 112, "title": "Invisible Child: Poverty, Survival & Hope in an American City", "rating": 5, "timestamp": "2022-10-05 15:54:03.195391+00:00", "pubdate": "2021-10-05", "last_modified": "2025-05-29 14:22:59.457405+00:00", "size": 2805902, "comments": "<div>\n<p>In Invisible Child, Pulitzer Prize winner Andrea Elliott follows eight dramatic years in the life of Dasani, a girl whose imagination is as soaring as the skyscrapers near her Brooklyn shelter.

Augusten Burroughs. For fans of Tina Fey, David Sedaris and anyone who's ever felt like a misfit, an outrageously funny and disturbing memoir from Jenny Lawson, aka The Bloggess. 'When I tell people that my father is kind of a total lunatic, they laugh and nod knowingly. they assure me that theirs is too, and that he's just a \"typical father\". And they're probably right, if the typical father runs a full-time taxidermy business out of the house, and shows up at the local bar with a miniature donkey and a teddy Roosevelt impersonator, and thinks other people are weird for making such a big deal out of it. If the typical father says things like \"Happy birthday! Here's a bathtub of raccoons!\" or \"We'll have to take your car. Mine has too much blood in it,\" then yeah, he's totally normal.' When Jenny Lawson was little, all she ever wanted was to fit in. that dream was cut short by her fantastically unbalanced father and a childhood of wearing winter shoes made out of used bread sacks. It did, however, open up an opportunity for Lawson to find the humour in the strange shame-spiral that is her life, and we are all the better for it. Lawson's long-suffering husband and sweet daughter help her uncover the surprising discovery that the most terribly human moments - the ones we want to pretend never happened - are the very same moments that make us the people we are today. Like laughing at a funeral, LEt'S PREtEND tHIS NEVER HAPPENED is both irreverent and impossible to hold back once you get started.

De twee vijftienjarige zoons van beide echtparen, Michel en Rick, hebben samen iets uitgehaald wat hun toekomst kan verwoesten. Tot dusver zijn alleen vage beelden van de twee in Opsporing verzocht vertoond en zit het onderzoek naar hun identiteit vast. Maar hoe lang nog?

R. Martin's epic high fantasy series. In A Game of Thrones, an ancient kingdom was torn by the ambitions of ruthless men and women; in A Clash of Kings, war, sorcery, and madness swept over the kingdom like a voracious beast of prey. Now, as the brutal struggle for power nears its tumultuous climax, the battered and divided kingdom faces its most terrifying invasion\u2014one that is being spearheaded from beyond the grave....</p>\n<p>A STORM OF SWORDS</p>\n<p>Of the five contenders for power, one is dead, another in disfavor, and still the wars rage as violently as ever, as alliances are made and broken. Joffrey, of House Lannister, sits on the Iron Throne, the uneasy ruler of the land of the Seven Kingdoms. His most bitter rival, Lord Stannis, stands defeated and disgraced, the victim of the jealous sorceress who holds him in her evil thrall. But young Robb, of House Stark, still rules the North from the fortress of Riverrun. Robb plots against his despised Lannister enemies, even as they hold his sister hostage at King's Landing, the seat of the Iron Throne. Meanwhile, making her way across a blood-drenched continent is the exiled queen, Daenerys, mistress of the only three dragons still left in the world. Filled with the stench of death and decay from the destructive dynastic war, Daenerys is gathering allies and strength for an assault on King's Landing, hoping to win back the crown she believes is rightfully hers. But as opposing forces maneuver for the final titanic showdown, an army of barbaric wildlings bent on overwhelming the Seven Kingdoms arrives from the outermost line of civilization. In their vanguard is a horde of mythical Others\u2014a supernatural army of the living dead whose animated corpses are unstoppable. And as the future of the land hangs in the balance, no one will rest in the quest for victory until the Seven Kingdoms have exploded in a veritable storm of swords.... Brilliantly conceived and grand in scope, A Storm of Swords is the incredible tale of a world of harsh beauty and powerful magic, torn by treachery, ravaged by brutality, and consumed by greed and ambition. It portrays a war-torn landscape in which nobles and commoners, heroes and villains, the freeborn and the enslaved, all struggle to survive and to find their destinies...along with the dazzling bounty and wondrous enchantment that was once their birthright in the Seven Kingdoms.</p></div>", "isbn": "9780553106633", "path": "George R.R.

With A Game of Thrones, George R. R. Martin has launched a genuine masterpiece, bringing together the best the genre has to offer. Mystery, intrigue, romance, and adventure fill the pages of this magnificent saga, the first volume in an epic series sure to delight fantasy fans everywhere.</p>\n<p>Long ago, in a time forgotten, a preternatural event threw the seasons out of balance. In a land where summers can last decades and winters a lifetime, trouble is brewing. The cold is returning, and in the frozen wastes to the north of Winterfell, sinister forces are massing beyond the kingdom's protective Wall. To the south, the king's powers are failing--his most trusted adviser dead under mysterious circumstances and his enemies emerging from the shadows of the throne. At the center of the conflict lie the Starks of Winterfell, a family as harsh and unyielding as the frozen land they were born to. Now Lord Eddard Stark is reluctantly summoned to serve as the king's new Hand, an appointment that threatens to sunder not only his family but the kingdom itself. Sweeping from a harsh land of cold to a summertime kingdom of epicurean plenty, A Game of Thrones tells a tale of lords and ladies, soldiers and sorcerers, assassins and bastards, who come together in a time of grim omens. Here an enigmatic band of warriors bear swords of no human metal; a tribe of fierce wildlings carry men off into madness; a cruel young dragon prince barters his sister to win back his thro\u2260 a child is lost in the twilight between life and death; and a determined woman undertakes a treacherous journey to protect all she holds dear. Amid plots and counter-plots, tragedy and betrayal, victory and terror, allies and enemies, the fate of the Starks hangs perilously in the balance, as each side endeavors to win that deadliest of conflicts: the game of thrones.

Very soon he's lured from his duties into a hunt for a fantastic treasure discovered by archaeologists and carefully hushed up. The long-vanished Martians who once colonised the galaxy have left a buried hyperspace gateway leading to a working starship in distant orbit.</p>\n<p>Kovacs uses frightening violence to get the attention of corporate sponsors even more ruthless than himself. His hastily assembled exploration team must work in a lethal fallout zone, racing to open the gate before they're stopped by radiation sickness, treacherous sabotage, or the threat of fast-evolving nanoweaponry. And there are repeated hints that if they ever make it through that gateway, worse things are waiting on the far side...</p>\n<p>It's all desperately tense and crafted with appalling inventiveness. Life is cheap and death is no release, because the \"cortical stack\" implanted in everyone's spine constantly records the total personality, ready for \"re-sleeving\" in a new clone body or storage in virtual reality. So Kovacs goes recruiting at the macabre Soul Market, where thanks to the war there are literal skiploads of hacked-out sections of human spine containing stacks--for sale by the kilogram.</p>\n<p>Other ingredients include sex, voodoo, torture, multiple betrayal, cool military technology, incomprehensible alien constructions, age-old cycles of catastrophe, and--above all--extreme violence. The screw is turned further and further, beyond what seems possible. Readers may find themselves forgetting to breathe.

It Doesn't Have to Be Crazy at Work is a direct successor to Rework, the instant bestseller that showed readers a new path to working effectively. Now Fried and Heinemeier Hansson have returned with a new strategy for the ideal company culture - what they call the calm company . It is a direct attack on the chaos, anxiety and stress that plagues millions of workplaces and billions of people working their day jobs. Working to breaking point with long hours, excessive workload, and a lack of sleep have become a badge of honour for many people these days, when it should be a mark of stupidity. This isn't just a problem for large organisations; individuals, contractors and solopreneurs are burning themselves out in the very same way. As the authors reveal, the answer isn't more hours. Rather, it's less waste and fewer things that induce distraction, always-on anxiety and stress. It is time to stop celebrating crazy and start celebrating calm. Fried and Hansson have the proof to back up their argument. Calm has been the cornerstone of their company's culture since Basecamp began twenty years ago. Destined to become the management guide for the next generation, It Doesn't Have to Be Crazy at Work is a practical and inspiring distillation of their insights and experiences. It isn't a book telling you what to do.

Drawing on in-depth interviews with entrepreneurs and investors who have actually put these models to use, Mullins goes on to address the key implementation issues that characterize each of the models: when to apply them, how best to apply them, and the pitfalls to watch out for.</p>\n<p>Whether you're an aspiring entrepreneur lacking the start-up capital you need, an early-stage entrepreneur trying to get your cash-starved venture into take-off mode, an intrapreneur seeking funding within an established company, or an angel investor or mentor who supports high-potential ventures, this book offers the most sure-footed path to starting, financing, or growing your venture.</p>\n<p>John Mullins is the author of The New Business Road Test and, with Randy Komisar, the widely acclaimed Getting to Plan B.</p></div>", "isbn": "9781118878859", "path": "John Mullins/The Customer-Funded Business (45)", "has_cover": 1, "flags": 1, "author_ids": ["41"], "series_ids": null, "publisher_ids": ["29"], "language_ids": ["1"], "tag_ids": ["11"], "identifier_ids": ["62", "65", "64", "63"], "order_by": "2022-10-04 13:46:45.526000+00:00", "authors": [{"id": 41, "name": "John Mullins", "count": 1, "avg_rating": 8.0, "sort": "Mullins, John"}], "publishers": [{"id": 29, "name": "Wiley", "count": 7, "avg_rating": 7.2, "sort": "Wiley"}], "languages": [{"id": 1, "name": "ENG", "count": 448, "avg_rating": 8.366795366795367, "sort": "ENG"}], "tags": [{"id": 11, "name": "Business & Economics", "count": 22, "avg_rating": 8.133333333333333, "sort": 22}], "identifiers": [{"id": 63, "book": 45, "type": "isbn", "val": "9781118878859", "sort": "isbn", "name": "ISBN", "path": "https://www.worldcat.org/isbn/9781118878859"}, {"id": 64, "book": 45, "type": "google", "val": "tnLYAwAAQBAJ", "sort": "google", "name": "Google Books", "path": "https://books.google.com/books?id=tnLYAwAAQBAJ"}, {"id": 65, "book": 45, "type": "goodreads", "val": "20605988", "sort": "goodreads", "name": "Goodreads", "path": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20605988"}, {"id": 62, "book": 45, "type": "barnesnoble", "val": "w/the-customer-funded-business-john-mullins/1118139154", "sort": "barnesnoble", "name": "Barnes & Noble", "path": "https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/the-customer-funded-business-john-mullins/1118139154"}], "custom_types": "eBook", "custom_reading_list": 0, "custom_read_date": "2021-10-06", "custom_lists": [], "custom_lists_ids": null, "custom_clean": 1}, {"id": 39, "title": "How to Talk to Anyone: 92 Little Tricks for Big Success in Relationships", "rating": 4, "timestamp": "2022-10-04 13:46:42.606000+00:00", "pubdate": "1998-10-01", "last_modified": "2025-05-29 14:22:59.457405+00:00", "size": 16189904, "comments": "<div>\n<p>Never be at a loss for words again!</p>\n<p>Perfect your people skills with his fun, witty and informative guide, containing 92 little tricks to create big success in personal and business relationships.</p>\n<p>In How To Talk To Anyone, bestselling relationships author and internationally renowned life coach Leil Lowndes reveals the secrets and psychology behind successful communication.

When we bring both respect and interpersonal savvy to our work relationships, we do more than make people feel good. We enhance personal and organizational performance. And as the workplace grows more complex and competitive, managing our work relationships becomes even more essential and difficult. Now more than ever we need to work people smart. Working PeopleSmart describes the six core strategies used by people-smart individuals and shows how to apply them in the toughest workplace situations. Individuals who are people smart know how to open others up rather than make them defensive or resistant. They have a knack for diffusing tension rather than creating it. They set a good example through their own behavior on the job and can inspire and influence others with less developed skills. Working PeopleSmart can serve as your virtual coach to guide you through difficult work relationships skillfully. How do you deal with a critical colleague? Make your boss listen to you? React to an offensive joke? Get the resources you need? The authors look at over 50 real-life situations and offer people-smart prescriptions for handling them effectively. They provide coaching tips for each scenario and describe exactly what a people-smart response sounds like. As two psychologists with both organizational and clinical expertise, coauthors Mel Silberman and Freda Hansburg are highly qualified to deliver the message that we can emerge from even the toughest interpersonal moments on the job with dignity and grace. Where other books rely on typologies that categorize people according to their interpersonal styles and then offer advice on how to deal with each type, the strategies described in Working PeopleSmart are straightforward and universal. They can be used immediately to deal with any type of person or any situation, no matter how difficult or sensitive.</p></div>", "isbn": "9781576752081", "path": "Melvin L.

She then journeyed to the region of Geneva, Switzerland, where much of the story takes place. The topic of galvanism and occult ideas were themes of conversation among her companions, particularly her lover and future husband Percy B. Shelley. Mary, Percy and Lord Byron had a competition to see who could write the best horror story. After thinking for days, Shelley dreamt about a scientist who created life and was horrified by what he had made, inspiring the novel. </p></div>", "isbn": "9798728798620", "path": "Mary Shelley/Frankenstein Illustrated (458)", "has_cover": 1, "flags": 1, "author_ids": ["478"], "series_ids": null, "publisher_ids": ["117"], "language_ids": ["1"], "tag_ids": null, "identifier_ids": ["1212", "1213"], "order_by": "2022-07-21 22:00:00+00:00", "authors": [{"id": 478, "name": "Mary Shelley", "count": 2, "avg_rating": 10.0, "sort": "Shelley, Mary"}], "publishers": [{"id": 117, "name": "Independently Published", "count": 15, "avg_rating": 7.6, "sort": "Independently Published"}], "languages": [{"id": 1, "name": "ENG", "count": 448, "avg_rating": 8.366795366795367, "sort": "ENG"}], "identifiers": [{"id": 1213, "book": 458, "type": "isbn", "val": "9798728798620", "sort": "isbn", "name": "ISBN", "path": "https://www.worldcat.org/isbn/9798728798620"}, {"id": 1212, "book": 458, "type": "google", "val": "bjlrzgEACAAJ", "sort": "google", "name": "Google Books", "path": "https://books.google.com/books?id=bjlrzgEACAAJ"}], "custom_types": "eBook", "custom_reading_list": 0, "custom_read_date": null, "custom_lists": [], "custom_lists_ids": null, "custom_clean": 1}, {"id": 468, "title": "De Kleur van Toverij", "rating": null, "timestamp": "2022-07-21 22:00:00+00:00", "pubdate": "2002-07-15", "last_modified": "2025-05-29 14:22:59.457405+00:00", "size": 384594, "comments": "<div>\n<p>\u2018Word jij dan niet bang als je hoog bent?\u2019 vroeg Rinzwind. \u2018Nee,\u2019 zei Tweebloesem. \u2018Waarom zou ik?

En wanneer trekt ze nu eindelijk eens een jurk aan met een fatsoenlijke heksenkleur...</p></div>", "isbn": "9789460926259", "path": "Terry Pratchett/Ik Ga in Middernacht (472)", "has_cover": 1, "flags": 1, "author_ids": ["174"], "series_ids": ["26"], "publisher_ids": ["235"], "language_ids": ["2"], "tag_ids": ["42", "75", "76", "88", "109"], "identifier_ids": ["1482", "1483", "1484", "1481", "1480"], "order_by": "2022-07-21 22:00:00+00:00", "authors": [{"id": 174, "name": "Terry Pratchett", "count": 86, "avg_rating": 9.166666666666666, "sort": "Pratchett, Terry"}], "series": [{"id": 26, "name": "Schijfwereld", "count": 41, "avg_rating": 8.4, "sort": "Schijfwereld"}], "publishers": [{"id": 235, "name": "Meulenhoff Boekerij B.V.", "count": 40, "avg_rating": 8.4, "sort": "Meulenhoff Boekerij B.V."}], "languages": [{"id": 2, "name": "NLD", "count": 62, "avg_rating": 8.0, "sort": "NLD"}], "tags": [{"id": 76, "name": "Fantasy", "count": 146, "avg_rating": 8.772727272727273, "sort": 146}, {"id": 75, "name": "Science Fiction", "count": 110, "avg_rating": 8.74074074074074, "sort": 110}, {"id": 42, "name": "Humour", "count": 84, "avg_rating": 8.761904761904763, "sort": 84}, {"id": 88, "name": "Young Adult", "count": 28, "avg_rating": 8.571428571428571, "sort": 28}, {"id": 109, "name": "Childrens", "count": 10, "avg_rating": 8.5, "sort": 10}], "identifiers": [{"id": 1480, "book": 472, "type": "isbn", "val": "9789460926259", "sort": "isbn", "name": "ISBN", "path": "https://www.worldcat.org/isbn/9789460926259"}, {"id": 1481, "book": 472, "type": "google", "val": "dnhfn3NJknAC", "sort": "google", "name": "Google Books", "path": "https://books.google.com/books?id=dnhfn3NJknAC"}, {"id": 1484, "book": 472, "type": "goodreads", "val": "18878461", "sort": "goodreads", "name": "Goodreads", "path": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18878461"}, {"id": 1483, "book": 472, "type": "amazon_nl", "val": "B00O285PRY", "sort": "amazon_nl", "name": "Amazon NL", "path": "https://amazon.nl/dp/B00O285PRY"}, {"id": 1482, "book": 472, "type": "amazon", "val": "B00O285PRY", "sort": "amazon", "name": "Amazon", "path": "https://amazon.com/dp/B00O285PRY"}], "custom_types": "eBook", "custom_reading_list": 0, "custom_read_date": null, "custom_lists": [], "custom_lists_ids": null, "custom_clean": 1}, {"id": 473, "title": "Academische Boys", "rating": null, "timestamp": "2022-07-21 22:00:00+00:00", "pubdate": "2010-07-15", "last_modified": "2025-05-29 14:22:59.457405+00:00", "size": 1243487, "comments": "<div>\n<p>Deze fantasyroman speelt in een denkbeeldige wereld die bevolkt wordt door allerlei creaturen zoals mensen, dwergen, trollen en orcen.

Door onvoldoende naleving van de bepalingen van dit legaat, dreigen zij echter deze inkomsten kwijt te raken. Alleen door een voetbalwedstrijd te spelen, waarin zij als een team optreden, kan dit gevaar afgewend worden. De grote vraag is nu hoe zij zo'n wedstrijd moeten organiseren. Dan treedt een orc, de kaarsenbedruiper Knett, naar voren, die deze taak op zich neemt. Naast de voetbalwedstrijd tegen een sluwe tegenstander, vinden ook andere ontwikkelingen plaats, waardoor het verhaal enigszins gecompliceerd en soms ook verward wordt. Met het populaire voetbal wordt op humoristische wijze soms de spot gedreven, zodat de roman ook satirische elementen bevat.</p></div>", "isbn": "9789022554845", "path": "Terry Pratchett/Academische Boys (473)", "has_cover": 1, "flags": 1, "author_ids": ["174"], "series_ids": ["26"], "publisher_ids": ["235"], "language_ids": ["2"], "tag_ids": null, "identifier_ids": ["1319", "1318"], "order_by": "2022-07-21 22:00:00+00:00", "authors": [{"id": 174, "name": "Terry Pratchett", "count": 86, "avg_rating": 9.166666666666666, "sort": "Pratchett, Terry"}], "series": [{"id": 26, "name": "Schijfwereld", "count": 41, "avg_rating": 8.4, "sort": "Schijfwereld"}], "publishers": [{"id": 235, "name": "Meulenhoff Boekerij B.V.", "count": 40, "avg_rating": 8.4, "sort": "Meulenhoff Boekerij B.V."}], "languages": [{"id": 2, "name": "NLD", "count": 62, "avg_rating": 8.0, "sort": "NLD"}], "identifiers": [{"id": 1318, "book": 473, "type": "isbn", "val": "9789022554845", "sort": "isbn", "name": "ISBN", "path": "https://www.worldcat.org/isbn/9789022554845"}, {"id": 1319, "book": 473, "type": "google", "val": "N1SIRAAACAAJ", "sort": "google", "name": "Google Books", "path": "https://books.google.com/books?id=N1SIRAAACAAJ"}], "custom_types": "eBook", "custom_reading_list": 0, "custom_read_date": null, "custom_lists": [], "custom_lists_ids": null, "custom_clean": 1}, {"id": 474, "title": "Meidezeggenschap", "rating": null, "timestamp": "2022-07-21 22:00:00+00:00", "pubdate": "2011-10-07", "last_modified": "2025-05-29 14:22:59.457405+00:00", "size": 315070, "comments": "<div>\n<p>\u2018Ik wil tovenaar worden,\u2019 zei Esk.

De Overgangers zijn ratten die op een vuilnishoop iets gegeten hebben waardoor ze kunnen denken. Samen met de kat Maurits, die ooit een rat met hersens oppeuzelde, hebben ze een lucratief zwendeltje bedacht. Ze trekken van stad naar stad, zorgen daar voor een rattenplaag en op dat moment verschijnt een fluitspelende jongen die het probleem op kan lossen. Uiteraard niet voor niets. Als het gezelschap in Bad Blientz arriveert, blijken in dat stadje al rattenmeppers actief te zijn. Een confrontatie blijft niet uit.

De spanning tussen trollen en dwergen stijgt als in beide bevolkingsgroepen een moord wordt gepleegd met een nieuw wapen, het vuroer (= geweer), uitgevonden door Leonard da Quorm (= Da Vinci). De verdenking valt op het Moordenaarsgilde maar de leden daarvan mogen niet moorden zonder vergunning. De Nachtwacht zoekt dit uit en probeert ondertussen de trollen en dwergen uit elkaar te houden die elkaar maar al te graag naar de keel vliegen. Ook de spanning binnen de Nachtwacht loopt op. Bovendien wil kapitein Flinx de moordenaar pakken voor zijn ontslag wegens huwelijk en raakt korporaal Biet verliefd op veldwachter Angoea zonder dat hij op de hoogte is dat ze een weerwolf is. Zelfstandig te lezen met verwijzing naar 'Wacht! Wacht!'*. Romantiek en heroiek met opnieuw een knipoogje naar de werkelijkheid.

In the newest appealing installment of the Discworld series, Pratchett (The Truth) takes on religion, time and... kung-fu movies? The cast includes Death; Miss Susan, Death's granddaughter; Jeremy Clockson, a clockmaker; Lobsang, a novice monk; and Lu-Tze, a sweeper at the temple of the History Monks. When a mysterious lady asks Jeremy to make a clock that is perfectly timed (even to the last tick), trouble begins it seems that such a clock would have the power to stop time completely. There would be no yesterday, no tomorrow, no next minute; in fact, everything and everyone would stop in its tracks. It's up to Miss Susan, Lobsang and Lu-Tze to figure out who in the end has decided to build the dangerous clock and how to stop him before the world crashes to a halt. Along the way we learn Rule One: \"Do not act incautiously when confronting a little bald wrinkly smiling man,\" which is a very good lesson to learn. We also find out that Lobsang has more in store for his future than to be an apprentice monk. The story includes a quick nod to James Bond flicks with Qu, the monk who supplies gadgets to Lu-Tze and Lobsang, and at the end of Time the four (no, make that five) horsemen of the Apocalypse get to ride out for a jaunt.

The story is set in Clayton County and Atlanta, both in Georgia, during the American Civil War and Reconstruction Era. It depicts the struggles of young Scarlett O'Hara, the spoiled daughter of a well-to-do plantation owner, who must use every means at her disposal to claw her way out of poverty following Sherman's destructive \"March to the Sea. </p>\n<p>This historical novel features a Bildungsroman or coming-of-age story, with the title taken from a poem written by Ernest Dowson. Gone with the Wind was popular with American readers from the outset and was the top American fiction bestseller in 1936 and 1937.

A classic of English literature, written with incisive wit and superb character delineation, it centres on the turbulent relationship between Elizabeth Bennet, the daughter of a country gentleman, and Fitzwilliam Darcy, a rich aristocratic landowner. The work, which Austen initially titled First Impressions, is the second of four novels that Austen published during her lifetime. Although Pride and Prejudice has been criticized for its lack of historical context, the existence of its characters in a social bubble that is rarely penetrated by events beyond it is an accurate portrayal of the enclosed social world in which Austen lived. She depicted that world, in all its own narrow pride and prejudice, with unswerving accuracy and satire. At the same time, she placed at its centre, as both its prime actor and most perceptive critic, a character so well conceived and rendered that the reader cannot but be gripped by her story and wish for its happy d\u00e9nouement. In the end, Austen's novel has remained popular largely because of Elizabeth-who was reportedly Austen's own favourite among all her heroines-and because of the enduring appeal to men and women alike of a well-told and potentially happily ending love story. Pride and Prejudice inspired various stage, film, and television productions. One of its most notable adaptations was a 1995 TV miniseries starring Jennifer Ehle (Elizabeth) and Colin Firth (Darcy). Parents need to know that Jane Austen's romantic masterpiece, Pride and Prejudice, is an absolute joy to read and study for teens who are open to the pleasures of 19th-century prose and manners.

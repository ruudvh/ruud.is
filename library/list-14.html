In 1942, with Nazis occupying Holland, a thirteen-year-old Jewish girl and her family fled their home in Amsterdam and went into hiding. For the next two years, until their whereabouts were betrayed to the Gestapo, they and another family lived cloistered in the \"Secret Annex\" of an old office building. Cut off from the outside world, they faced hunger, boredom, the constant cruelties of living in confined quarters, and the ever-present threat of discovery and death. In her diary Anne Frank recorded vivid impressions of her experiences during this period.

Out of their trials and their repeated collisions against the hard realities of an America divided into Haves and Have-Nots evolves a drama that is intensely human yet majestic in its scale and moral vision, elemental yet plainspoken, tragic but ultimately stirring in its human dignity. A portrait of the conflict between the powerful and the powerless, of one man\u2019s fierce reaction to injustice, and of one woman\u2019s stoical strength, the novel captures the horrors of the Great Depression and probes into the very nature of equality and justice in America. At once a naturalistic epic, captivity narrative, road novel, and transcendental gospel, Steinbeck\u2019s powerful landmark novel is perhaps the most American of American Classics. \u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e", "custom_clean": 1, "custom_lists": [{"id": 14, "sort": "Must Read.25 Must Read", "value": "Must Read.25 Must Read"}], "custom_lists_ids": "14", "custom_read_date": null, "custom_reading_list": 0, "custom_types": "eBook", "flags": 1, "has_cover": 1, "id": 446, "identifier_ids": "1239,1238,1240", "identifiers": [{"book": 446, "id": 1240, "name": "ISBN", "path": "https://www.worldcat.org/isbn/9780143039433", "sort": "isbn", "type": "isbn", "val": "9780143039433"}, {"book": 446, "id": 1238, "name": "Google Books", "path": "https://books.google.com/books?id=bhJgd3hGdxQC", "sort": "google", "type": "google", "val": "bhJgd3hGdxQC"}, {"book": 446, "id": 1239, "name": "Amazon", "path": "https://amazon.com/dp/0143039431", "sort": "amazon", "type": "amazon", "val": "0143039431"}], "isbn": "9780143039433", "language_ids": "1", "languages": [{"avg_rating": 8.429245283018869, "count": 341, "id": 1, "name": "ENG", "sort": "ENG"}], "last_modified": "2023-07-21 14:32:47.527874+00:00", "order_by": "2020-03-03 23:00:00+00:00", "path": "John Steinbeck/The Grapes of Wrath (446)", "pubdate": "2006-03-27", "publisher_ids": "90", "publishers": [{"avg_rating": 8.8, "count": 20, "id": 90, "name": "Penguin Random House", "sort": "Penguin Random House"}], "rating": 5, "series": [], "series_ids": null, "size": 1950305, "tag_ids": "4,148,152,153,349,400,401,402,403,404,405,406,407", "tags": [{"avg_rating": 9.25, "count": 97, "id": 4, "name": "Fiction", "sort": 97}, {"avg_rating": 8.461538461538462, "count": 47, "id": 349, "name": "General", "sort": 47}, {"avg_rating": 8.578947368421053, "count": 28, "id": 153, "name": "Classics", "sort": 28}, {"avg_rating": 9.0, "count": 11, "id": 152, "name": "Literary", "sort": 11}, {"avg_rating": 9.333333333333334, "count": 5, "id": 148, "name": "Historical", "sort": 5}, {"avg_rating": 10.0, "count": 1, "id": 400, "name": "Domestic fiction", "sort": 1}, {"avg_rating": 10.0, "count": 1, "id": 401, "name": "Political fiction", "sort": 1}, {"avg_rating": 10.0, "count": 1, "id": 402, "name": "California", "sort": 1}, {"avg_rating": 10.0, "count": 1, "id": 403, "name": "Rural families", "sort": 1}, {"avg_rating": 10.0, "count": 1, "id": 404, "name": "Migrant agricultural laborers", "sort": 1}, {"avg_rating": 10.0, "count": 1, "id": 405, "name": "Depressions", "sort": 1}, {"avg_rating": 10.0, "count": 1, "id": 406, "name": "Labor camps", "sort": 1}, {"avg_rating": 10.0, "count": 1, "id": 407, "name": "Oklahoma", "sort": 1}], "timestamp": "2020-03-03 23:00:00+00:00", "title": "The Grapes of Wrath"}, {"author_ids": "484", "authors": [{"avg_rating": 10.0, "count": 1, "id": 484, "name": "Markus Zusak", "sort": "Zusak, Markus"}], "comments": "\u003cdiv\u003e\n\u003cp style=\"font-style: italic\"\u003eWhen Death has a story to tell, you listen. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt is 1939.

A classic of English literature, written with incisive wit and superb character delineation, it centres on the turbulent relationship between Elizabeth Bennet, the daughter of a country gentleman, and Fitzwilliam Darcy, a rich aristocratic landowner. The work, which Austen initially titled First Impressions, is the second of four novels that Austen published during her lifetime. Although Pride and Prejudice has been criticized for its lack of historical context, the existence of its characters in a social bubble that is rarely penetrated by events beyond it is an accurate portrayal of the enclosed social world in which Austen lived. She depicted that world, in all its own narrow pride and prejudice, with unswerving accuracy and satire. At the same time, she placed at its centre, as both its prime actor and most perceptive critic, a character so well conceived and rendered that the reader cannot but be gripped by her story and wish for its happy d\u00e9nouement. In the end, Austen\u0027s novel has remained popular largely because of Elizabeth-who was reportedly Austen\u0027s own favourite among all her heroines-and because of the enduring appeal to men and women alike of a well-told and potentially happily ending love story. Pride and Prejudice inspired various stage, film, and television productions. One of its most notable adaptations was a 1995 TV miniseries starring Jennifer Ehle (Elizabeth) and Colin Firth (Darcy). Parents need to know that Jane Austen\u0027s romantic masterpiece, Pride and Prejudice, is an absolute joy to read and study for teens who are open to the pleasures of 19th-century prose and manners.

In 1942, with Nazis occupying Holland, a thirteen-year-old Jewish girl and her family fled their home in Amsterdam and went into hiding. For the next two years, until their whereabouts were betrayed to the Gestapo, they and another family lived cloistered in the \"Secret Annex\" of an old office building. Cut off from the outside world, they faced hunger, boredom, the constant cruelties of living in confined quarters, and the ever-present threat of discovery and death.

Out of their trials and their repeated collisions against the hard realities of an America divided into Haves and Have-Nots evolves a drama that is intensely human yet majestic in its scale and moral vision, elemental yet plainspoken, tragic but ultimately stirring in its human dignity. A portrait of the conflict between the powerful and the powerless, of one man\u2019s fierce reaction to injustice, and of one woman\u2019s stoical strength, the novel captures the horrors of the Great Depression and probes into the very nature of equality and justice in America. At once a naturalistic epic, captivity narrative, road novel, and transcendental gospel, Steinbeck\u2019s powerful landmark novel is perhaps the most American of American Classics. \u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e", "custom_clean": 1, "custom_lists": [{"id": 14, "sort": "Must Read.25 Must Read", "value": "Must Read.25 Must Read"}], "custom_lists_ids": "14", "custom_read_date": null, "custom_reading_list": 0, "custom_types": "eBook", "flags": 1, "has_cover": 1, "id": 446, "identifier_ids": "1239,1238,1240", "identifiers": [{"book": 446, "id": 1240, "name": "ISBN", "path": "https://www.worldcat.org/isbn/9780143039433", "sort": "isbn", "type": "isbn", "val": "9780143039433"}, {"book": 446, "id": 1238, "name": "Google Books", "path": "https://books.google.com/books?id=bhJgd3hGdxQC", "sort": "google", "type": "google", "val": "bhJgd3hGdxQC"}, {"book": 446, "id": 1239, "name": "Amazon", "path": "https://amazon.com/dp/0143039431", "sort": "amazon", "type": "amazon", "val": "0143039431"}], "isbn": "9780143039433", "language_ids": "1", "languages": [{"avg_rating": 8.429245283018869, "count": 341, "id": 1, "name": "ENG", "sort": "ENG"}], "last_modified": "2023-07-21 14:32:47.527874+00:00", "order_by": "2020-03-03 23:00:00+00:00", "path": "John Steinbeck/The Grapes of Wrath (446)", "pubdate": "2006-03-27", "publisher_ids": "90", "publishers": [{"avg_rating": 8.8, "count": 20, "id": 90, "name": "Penguin Random House", "sort": "Penguin Random House"}], "rating": 5, "series": [], "series_ids": null, "size": 1950305, "tag_ids": "4,148,152,153,349,400,401,402,403,404,405,406,407", "tags": [{"avg_rating": 9.25, "count": 97, "id": 4, "name": "Fiction", "sort": 97}, {"avg_rating": 8.461538461538462, "count": 47, "id": 349, "name": "General", "sort": 47}, {"avg_rating": 8.578947368421053, "count": 28, "id": 153, "name": "Classics", "sort": 28}, {"avg_rating": 9.0, "count": 11, "id": 152, "name": "Literary", "sort": 11}, {"avg_rating": 9.333333333333334, "count": 5, "id": 148, "name": "Historical", "sort": 5}, {"avg_rating": 10.0, "count": 1, "id": 400, "name": "Domestic fiction", "sort": 1}, {"avg_rating": 10.0, "count": 1, "id": 401, "name": "Political fiction", "sort": 1}, {"avg_rating": 10.0, "count": 1, "id": 402, "name": "California", "sort": 1}, {"avg_rating": 10.0, "count": 1, "id": 403, "name": "Rural families", "sort": 1}, {"avg_rating": 10.0, "count": 1, "id": 404, "name": "Migrant agricultural laborers", "sort": 1}, {"avg_rating": 10.0, "count": 1, "id": 405, "name": "Depressions", "sort": 1}, {"avg_rating": 10.0, "count": 1, "id": 406, "name": "Labor camps", "sort": 1}, {"avg_rating": 10.0, "count": 1, "id": 407, "name": "Oklahoma", "sort": 1}], "timestamp": "2020-03-03 23:00:00+00:00", "title": "The Grapes of Wrath"}, {"author_ids": "484", "authors": [{"avg_rating": 10.0, "count": 1, "id": 484, "name": "Markus Zusak", "sort": "Zusak, Markus"}], "comments": "\u003cdiv\u003e\n\u003cp style=\"font-style: italic\"\u003eWhen Death has a story to tell, you listen. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt is 1939.

A classic of English literature, written with incisive wit and superb character delineation, it centres on the turbulent relationship between Elizabeth Bennet, the daughter of a country gentleman, and Fitzwilliam Darcy, a rich aristocratic landowner. The work, which Austen initially titled First Impressions, is the second of four novels that Austen published during her lifetime. Although Pride and Prejudice has been criticized for its lack of historical context, the existence of its characters in a social bubble that is rarely penetrated by events beyond it is an accurate portrayal of the enclosed social world in which Austen lived. She depicted that world, in all its own narrow pride and prejudice, with unswerving accuracy and satire. At the same time, she placed at its centre, as both its prime actor and most perceptive critic, a character so well conceived and rendered that the reader cannot but be gripped by her story and wish for its happy d\u00e9nouement. In the end, Austen\u0027s novel has remained popular largely because of Elizabeth-who was reportedly Austen\u0027s own favourite among all her heroines-and because of the enduring appeal to men and women alike of a well-told and potentially happily ending love story. Pride and Prejudice inspired various stage, film, and television productions. One of its most notable adaptations was a 1995 TV miniseries starring Jennifer Ehle (Elizabeth) and Colin Firth (Darcy). Parents need to know that Jane Austen\u0027s romantic masterpiece, Pride and Prejudice, is an absolute joy to read and study for teens who are open to the pleasures of 19th-century prose and manners.

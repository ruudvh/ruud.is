No one in her family, in either the United States or Colombia, spoke of infectious diseases, and even into her thirties, she only knew that her aunt had died of a rare illness called Chagas. But as Hern\u00e1ndez dug deeper, she discovered that Chagas\u2014or the kissing bug disease\u2014is more prevalent in the United States than the Zika virus. Today, more than three hundred thousand Americans have Chagas.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy do some infectious diseases make headlines and others fall by the wayside? After her aunt\u0027s death, Hern\u00e1ndez begins searching for answers about who our nation chooses to take care of and who we ignore. Crisscrossing the country, she interviews patients, epidemiologists, and even veterinarians with the Department of Defense. She learns that outside of Latin America, the United States is the only country with the native insects\u2014the \"kissing bugs\"\u2014that carry the Chagas parasite. She spends a night in southwest Texas hunting the dreaded bug with university researchers. She also gets to know patients, like a mother whose premature baby was born infected with the parasite, his heart already damaged. And she meets one cardiologist battling the disease in Los Angeles County with local volunteers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Kissing Bug tells the story of how poverty, racism, and public policies have conspired to keep this disease hidden\u2014and how the disease intersects with Hern\u00e1ndez\u0027s own identity as a niece, sister, and daughter; a queer woman; a writer and researcher; and a citizen of a country that is only beginning to address the harms caused by Chagas and the dangers it poses. A riveting and nuanced investigation into racial politics and for-profit health care in the United States, The Kissing Bug reveals the intimate history of a marginalized disease and connects us to the lives at the center of it all.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e", "custom_clean": 1, "custom_lists": [{"id": 5, "sort": "Must Read.2021 Time", "value": "Must Read.2021 Time"}], "custom_lists_ids": "5", "custom_read_date": null, "custom_reading_list": 0, "custom_types": "eBook", "flags": 1, "has_cover": 1, "id": 148, "identifier_ids": "359,361,360", "identifiers": [{"book": 148, "id": 360, "name": "ISBN", "path": "https://www.worldcat.org/isbn/9781953534194", "sort": "isbn", "type": "isbn", "val": "9781953534194"}, {"book": 148, "id": 361, "name": "Google Books", "path": "https://books.google.com/books?id=xC-3zgEACAAJ", "sort": "google", "type": "google", "val": "xC-3zgEACAAJ"}, {"book": 148, "id": 359, "name": "Goodreads", "path": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/61268043", "sort": "goodreads", "type": "goodreads", "val": "61268043"}], "isbn": "9781953534194", "language_ids": "1", "languages": [{"avg_rating": 8.429245283018869, "count": 341, "id": 1, "name": "ENG", "sort": "ENG"}], "last_modified": "2023-05-04 17:55:52.136675+00:00", "order_by": "2022-10-05 15:54:16.610501+00:00", "path": "Daisy Hernandez/The Kissing Bug (148)", "pubdate": "2021-06-01", "publisher_ids": "89", "publishers": [{"avg_rating": 8.0, "count": 2, "id": 89, "name": "Tin House Books, LLC", "sort": "Tin House Books, LLC"}], "rating": 4, "series": [], "series_ids": null, "size": 2070235, "tag_ids": "92,121,138,139,194", "tags": [{"avg_rating": 8.333333333333334, "count": 40, "id": 194, "name": "Time", "sort": 40}, {"avg_rating": 8.222222222222221, "count": 31, "id": 92, "name": "Biography", "sort": 31}, {"avg_rating": 9.6, "count": 6, "id": 121, "name": "Social Science", "sort": 6}, {"avg_rating": 8.0, "count": 3, "id": 138, "name": "Medical", "sort": 3}, {"avg_rating": 8.0, "count": 2, "id": 139, "name": "Disease \u0026 Health Issues", "sort": 2}], "timestamp": "2022-10-05 15:54:16.610501+00:00", "title": "The Kissing Bug"}, {"author_ids": "150,156", "authors": [{"avg_rating": 8.0, "count": 1, "id": 150, "name": "Deborah Levy", "sort": "Levy, Deborah"}, {"avg_rating": 8.0, "count": 1, "id": 156, "name": "Cruz Rod\u00edguez", "sort": "Rod\u00edguez, Cruz"}], "comments": "\u003cdiv\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom one of the great thinkers and writers of our time, comes the highly anticipated final instalment in Deborah Levy\u0027s critically acclaimed \u0027Living Autobiography\u0027\u003cbr\u003e\u0027I can\u0027t think of any writer aside from Virginia Woolf who writes better about what it is to be a woman\u0027 Observer on The Cost of Living\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFollowing the international critical acclaim of The Cost of Living , this final volume of Deborah Levy\u0027s \u0027Living Autobiography\u0027 is an exhilarating, thought-provoking and boldly intimate meditation on home and the spectres that haunt it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0027I began to wonder what myself and all unwritten and unseen women would possess in their property portfolios at the end of their lives.

Sullivan, Jr., Washington Post From one of our top historians, a groundbreaking story of policing and \u201criots\u201d that shatters our understanding of the post\u2013civil rights era. What began in spring 2020 as local protests in response to the killing of George Floyd by Minneapolis police quickly exploded into a massive nationwide movement. Millions of mostly young people defiantly flooded into the nation\u2019s streets, demanding an end to police brutality and to the broader, systemic repression of Black people and other people of color. To many observers, the protests appeared to be without precedent in their scale and persistence. Yet, as the acclaimed historian Elizabeth Hinton demonstrates in America on Fire, the events of 2020 had clear precursors\u2014and any attempt to understand our current crisis requires a reckoning with the recent past. Even in the aftermath of Donald Trump, many Americans consider the decades since the civil rights movement in the mid-1960s as a story of progress toward greater inclusiveness and equality. Hinton\u2019s sweeping narrative uncovers an altogether different history, taking us on a troubling journey from Detroit in 1967 and Miami in 1980 to Los Angeles in 1992 and beyond to chart the persistence of structural racism and one of its primary consequences, the so-called urban riot. Hinton offers a critical corrective: the word riot was nothing less than a racist trope applied to events that can only be properly understood as rebellions\u2014explosions of collective resistance to an unequal and violent order. As she suggests, if rebellion and the conditions that precipitated it never disappeared, the optimistic story of a post\u2013Jim Crow United States no longer holds. Black rebellion, America on Fire powerfully illustrates, was born in response to poverty and exclusion, but most immediately in reaction to police violence. In 1968, President Lyndon Johnson launched the \u201cWar on Crime,\u201d sending militarized police forces into impoverished Black neighborhoods. Facing increasing surveillance and brutality, residents threw rocks and Molotov cocktails at officers, plundered local businesses, and vandalized exploitative institutions. Hinton draws on exclusive sources to uncover a previously hidden geography of violence in smaller American cities, from York, Pennsylvania, to Cairo, Illinois, to Stockton, California. The central lesson from these eruptions\u2014that police violence invariably leads to community violence\u2014continues to escape policymakers, who respond by further criminalizing entire groups instead of addressing underlying socioeconomic causes. The results are the hugely expanded policing and prison regimes that shape the lives of so many Americans today. Presenting a new framework for understanding our nation\u2019s enduring strife, America on Fire is also a warning: rebellions will surely continue unless police are no longer called on to manage the consequences of dismal conditions beyond their control, and until an oppressive system is finally remade on the principles of justice and equality.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e", "custom_clean": 1, "custom_lists": [{"id": 5, "sort": "Must Read.2021 Time", "value": "Must Read.2021 Time"}], "custom_lists_ids": "5", "custom_read_date": null, "custom_reading_list": 0, "custom_types": "eBook", "flags": 1, "has_cover": 1, "id": 144, "identifier_ids": "351,352,353", "identifiers": [{"book": 144, "id": 353, "name": "ISBN", "path": "https://www.worldcat.org/isbn/9781631498916", "sort": "isbn", "type": "isbn", "val": "9781631498916"}, {"book": 144, "id": 352, "name": "Google Books", "path": "https://books.google.com/books?id=PAwDEAAAQBAJ", "sort": "google", "type": "google", "val": "PAwDEAAAQBAJ"}, {"book": 144, "id": 351, "name": "Goodreads", "path": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/55298326", "sort": "goodreads", "type": "goodreads", "val": "55298326"}], "isbn": "9781631498916", "language_ids": "1", "languages": [{"avg_rating": 8.429245283018869, "count": 341, "id": 1, "name": "ENG", "sort": "ENG"}], "last_modified": "2023-05-04 17:55:52.136675+00:00", "order_by": "2022-10-05 15:54:15.142378+00:00", "path": "Elizabeth Hinton/America on Fire_ The Untold History (144)", "pubdate": "2021-05-18", "publisher_ids": "84", "publishers": [{"avg_rating": 8.0, "count": 4, "id": 84, "name": "Liveright Publishing", "sort": "Liveright Publishing"}], "rating": 4, "series": [], "series_ids": null, "size": 12900649, "tag_ids": "57,60,194", "tags": [{"avg_rating": 8.333333333333334, "count": 40, "id": 194, "name": "Time", "sort": 40}, {"avg_rating": 8.363636363636363, "count": 24, "id": 60, "name": "History", "sort": 24}, {"avg_rating": 8.347826086956522, "count": 23, "id": 57, "name": "Politics", "sort": 23}], "timestamp": "2022-10-05 15:54:15.142378+00:00", "title": "America on Fire: The Untold History of Police Violence and Black Rebellion Since the 1960s"}, {"author_ids": "145", "authors": [{"avg_rating": 8.0, "count": 1, "id": 145, "name": "Elizabeth Kolbert", "sort": "Kolbert, Elizabeth"}], "comments": "\u003cdiv\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNATIONAL BESTSELLER * The Pulitzer Prize-winning author of The Sixth Extinction returns to humanity\u0027s transformative impact on the environment, now asking: After doing so much damage, can we change nature, this time to save it?

So pervasive are human impacts on the planet that it\u0027s said we live in a new geological epoch: the Anthropocene. In Under a White Sky, Elizabeth Kolbert takes a hard look at the new world we are creating. Along the way, she meets biologists who are trying to preserve the world\u0027s rarest fish, which lives in a single tiny pool in the middle of the Mojave; engineers who are turning carbon emissions to stone in Iceland; Australian researchers who are trying to develop a \"super coral\" that can survive on a hotter globe; and physicists who are contemplating shooting tiny diamonds into the stratosphere to cool the earth. One way to look at human civilization, says Kolbert, is as a ten-thousand-year exercise in defying nature. In The Sixth Extinction, she explored the ways in which our capacity for destruction has reshaped the natural world. Now she examines how the very sorts of interventions that have imperiled our planet are increasingly seen as the only hope for its salvation. By turns inspiring, terrifying, and darkly comic, Under a White Sky is an utterly original examination of the challenges we face.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e", "custom_clean": 1, "custom_lists": [{"id": 5, "sort": "Must Read.2021 Time", "value": "Must Read.2021 Time"}], "custom_lists_ids": "5", "custom_read_date": null, "custom_reading_list": 0, "custom_types": "eBook", "flags": 1, "has_cover": 1, "id": 143, "identifier_ids": "462,461,460,459", "identifiers": [{"book": 143, "id": 459, "name": "ISBN", "path": "https://www.worldcat.org/isbn/9780593136287", "sort": "isbn", "type": "isbn", "val": "9780593136287"}, {"book": 143, "id": 460, "name": "Google Books", "path": "https://books.google.com/books?id=qwpjEAAAQBAJ", "sort": "google", "type": "google", "val": "qwpjEAAAQBAJ"}, {"book": 143, "id": 461, "name": "Goodreads", "path": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/60757903", "sort": "goodreads", "type": "goodreads", "val": "60757903"}, {"book": 143, "id": 462, "name": "Amazon", "path": "https://amazon.com/dp/B08DMWR6BP", "sort": "amazon", "type": "amazon", "val": "B08DMWR6BP"}], "isbn": "9780593136287", "language_ids": "1", "languages": [{"avg_rating": 8.429245283018869, "count": 341, "id": 1, "name": "ENG", "sort": "ENG"}], "last_modified": "2023-05-04 17:55:52.136675+00:00", "order_by": "2022-10-05 15:54:14.761371+00:00", "path": "Elizabeth Kolbert/Under a White Sky_ The Nature of th (143)", "pubdate": "2021-02-09", "publisher_ids": "100", "publishers": [{"avg_rating": 8.0, "count": 6, "id": 100, "name": "Crown Publishing Group", "sort": "Crown Publishing Group"}], "rating": 4, "series": [], "series_ids": null, "size": 4317039, "tag_ids": "57,58,60,125,194,253", "tags": [{"avg_rating": 8.333333333333334, "count": 40, "id": 194, "name": "Time", "sort": 40}, {"avg_rating": 8.363636363636363, "count": 24, "id": 60, "name": "History", "sort": 24}, {"avg_rating": 8.347826086956522, "count": 23, "id": 57, "name": "Politics", "sort": 23}, {"avg_rating": 8.222222222222221, "count": 11, "id": 58, "name": "Science", "sort": 11}, {"avg_rating": 8.0, "count": 2, "id": 253, "name": "Non-Fiction", "sort": 2}, {"avg_rating": 8.0, "count": 1, "id": 125, "name": "Climate Crisis", "sort": 1}], "timestamp": "2022-10-05 15:54:14.761371+00:00", "title": "Under a White Sky: The Nature of the Future"}, {"author_ids": "144", "authors": [{"avg_rating": 8.0, "count": 1, "id": 144, "name": "Gabriel Krauze", "sort": "Krauze, Gabriel"}], "comments": "\u003cdiv\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLonglisted for the Booker Prize 2020 A Spectator Book of the Year \u0027A literary rendering of the Top Boy generation...

From the financial crisis to rising student debt to collapsing public infrastructure, she found a common root problem: racism. But not just in the most obvious indignities for people of color. Racism has costs for white people, too. It is the common denominator of our most vexing public problems, the core dysfunction of our democracy and constitutive of the spiritual and moral crises that grip us all. But how did this happen?

Along the way, she meets white people who confide in her about losing their homes, their dreams, and their shot at better jobs to the toxic mix of American racism and greed. This is the story of how public goods in this country--from parks and pools to functioning schools--have become private luxuries; of how unions collapsed, wages stagnated, and inequality increased; and of how this country, unique among the world\u0027s advanced economies, has thwarted universal healthcare.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut in unlikely places of worship and work, McGhee finds proof of what she calls the Solidarity Dividend: gains that come when people come together across race, to accomplish what we simply can\u0027t do on our own.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMcGhee marshals economic and sociological research to paint a story of racism\u0027s costs, but at the heart of the book are the humble stories of people yearning to be part of a better America, including white supremacy\u0027s collateral victims: white people themselves.

Nobody, including the lawmakers who passed the bill, expected it to transform the country\u2019s demographics. But over the next four decades, millions arrived, including Jay Caspian Kang\u2019s parents, grandparents, aunts, and uncles. They came with almost no understanding of their new home, much less the history of \u201cAsian America\u201d that was supposed to define them.\u00a0The Loneliest Americans is the unforgettable story of Kang and his family as they move from a housing project in Cambridge to an idyllic college town in the South and eventually to the West Coast. Their story unfolds against the backdrop of a rapidly expanding Asian America, as millions more immigrants, many of them working-class or undocumented, stream into the country. At the same time, upwardly mobile urban professionals have struggled to reconcile their parents\u2019 assimilationist goals with membership in a multicultural elite\u2014all while trying to carve out a new kind of belonging for their own children, who are neither white nor truly \u201cpeople of color.\u201d\u00a0Kang recognizes this existential loneliness in himself and in other Asian Americans who try to locate themselves in the country\u2019s racial binary. There are the businessmen turning Flushing into a center of immigrant wealth; the casualties of the Los Angeles riots; the impoverished parents in New York City who believe that admission to the city\u2019s exam schools is the only way out; the men\u2019s right\u2019s activists on Reddit ranting about intermarriage; and the handful of protesters who show up at Black Lives Matter rallies holding \u201cYellow Peril Supports Black Power\u201d signs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKang\u2019s exquisitely crafted book brings these lonely parallel climbers together and calls for a new immigrant solidarity\u2014one rooted not in bubble tea and elite college admissions but in the struggles of refugees and the working class.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e", "custom_clean": 1, "custom_lists": [{"id": 5, "sort": "Must Read.2021 Time", "value": "Must Read.2021 Time"}], "custom_lists_ids": "5", "custom_read_date": null, "custom_reading_list": 0, "custom_types": "eBook", "flags": 1, "has_cover": 1, "id": 137, "identifier_ids": "332,333,331", "identifiers": [{"book": 137, "id": 331, "name": "ISBN", "path": "https://www.worldcat.org/isbn/9780525576242", "sort": "isbn", "type": "isbn", "val": "9780525576242"}, {"book": 137, "id": 333, "name": "Google Books", "path": "https://books.google.com/books?id=vYMvEAAAQBAJ", "sort": "google", "type": "google", "val": "vYMvEAAAQBAJ"}, {"book": 137, "id": 332, "name": "Goodreads", "path": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/58145392", "sort": "goodreads", "type": "goodreads", "val": "58145392"}], "isbn": "9780525576242", "language_ids": "1", "languages": [{"avg_rating": 8.429245283018869, "count": 341, "id": 1, "name": "ENG", "sort": "ENG"}], "last_modified": "2023-05-04 17:55:52.136675+00:00", "order_by": "2022-10-05 15:54:12.577840+00:00", "path": "Jay Caspian Kang/The Loneliest Americans (137)", "pubdate": "2021-10-12", "publisher_ids": "100", "publishers": [{"avg_rating": 8.0, "count": 6, "id": 100, "name": "Crown Publishing Group", "sort": "Crown Publishing Group"}], "rating": 4, "series": [], "series_ids": null, "size": 1727399, "tag_ids": "57,60,92,194", "tags": [{"avg_rating": 8.333333333333334, "count": 40, "id": 194, "name": "Time", "sort": 40}, {"avg_rating": 8.222222222222221, "count": 31, "id": 92, "name": "Biography", "sort": 31}, {"avg_rating": 8.363636363636363, "count": 24, "id": 60, "name": "History", "sort": 24}, {"avg_rating": 8.347826086956522, "count": 23, "id": 57, "name": "Politics", "sort": 23}], "timestamp": "2022-10-05 15:54:12.577840+00:00", "title": "The Loneliest Americans"}, {"author_ids": "138", "authors": [{"avg_rating": 8.0, "count": 1, "id": 138, "name": "Jesse McCarthy", "sort": "McCarthy, Jesse"}], "comments": "\u003cdiv\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRanging from Ta-Nehisi Coates\u2019s case for reparations to Toni Morrison\u2019s revolutionary humanism to D\u2019Angelo\u2019s simmering blend of R and racial justice, Jesse McCarthy\u2019s bracing essays investigate with virtuosic intensity the art, music, literature, and political stances that have defined the twenty-first century.

The result is an extraordinary new contribution to the literature of grief and the American family, and a provocative and transformative meditation on who we become under the specter of loss.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e", "custom_clean": 1, "custom_lists": [{"id": 5, "sort": "Must Read.2021 Time", "value": "Must Read.2021 Time"}], "custom_lists_ids": "5", "custom_read_date": null, "custom_reading_list": 0, "custom_types": "eBook", "flags": 1, "has_cover": 1, "id": 135, "identifier_ids": "324,325,327,326", "identifiers": [{"book": 135, "id": 326, "name": "ISBN", "path": "https://www.worldcat.org/isbn/9781538716304", "sort": "isbn", "type": "isbn", "val": "9781538716304"}, {"book": 135, "id": 327, "name": "Google Books", "path": "https://books.google.com/books?id=6WrhDwAAQBAJ", "sort": "google", "type": "google", "val": "6WrhDwAAQBAJ"}, {"book": 135, "id": 325, "name": "Goodreads", "path": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/53376379", "sort": "goodreads", "type": "goodreads", "val": "53376379"}, {"book": 135, "id": 324, "name": "Amazon", "path": "https://amazon.com/dp/1538716321", "sort": "amazon", "type": "amazon", "val": "1538716321"}], "isbn": "9781538716304", "language_ids": "1", "languages": [{"avg_rating": 8.429245283018869, "count": 341, "id": 1, "name": "ENG", "sort": "ENG"}], "last_modified": "2023-05-04 17:55:52.136675+00:00", "order_by": "2022-10-05 15:54:11.863737+00:00", "path": "Kat Chow/Seeing Ghosts_ A Memoir (135)", "pubdate": "2021-08-24", "publisher_ids": "11", "publishers": [{"avg_rating": 9.0, "count": 2, "id": 11, "name": "Grand Central Publishing", "sort": "Grand Central Publishing"}], "rating": 4, "series": [], "series_ids": null, "size": 12348449, "tag_ids": "50,92,194", "tags": [{"avg_rating": 8.333333333333334, "count": 40, "id": 194, "name": "Time", "sort": 40}, {"avg_rating": 8.421052631578947, "count": 38, "id": 50, "name": "Adult", "sort": 38}, {"avg_rating": 8.222222222222221, "count": 31, "id": 92, "name": "Biography", "sort": 31}], "timestamp": "2022-10-05 15:54:11.863737+00:00", "title": "Seeing Ghosts: A Memoir"}, {"author_ids": "136", "authors": [{"avg_rating": 6.0, "count": 1, "id": 136, "name": "Lesley Chow", "sort": "Chow, Lesley"}], "comments": "\u003cdiv\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRaucous, sensual and sublime: how twelve pioneering female artists rewrote the rules of pop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom Kate Bush to Nicki Minaj, from Janet Jackson to TLC and Taylor Swift, pop\u0027s greatest female pioneers are simply strange: smashing notions of taste and decorum, and replacing them with new ideals of pleasure.

Pop Song is a book about love and about falling in love\u2014with a place, or a painting, or a person\u2014and the joy and terror inherent in the experience of that love. Plumbing the well of culture for clues and patterns about love and loss\u2014from Agnes Martin\u0027s abstract paintings to James Turrell\u0027s transcendent light works, and Anne Carson\u0027s Eros the Bittersweet to Frank Ocean\u0027s Blonde\u2014Pham writes of her youthful attempts to find meaning in travel, sex, drugs, and art, before sensing that she might need to turn her gaze upon herself. Pop Song is also a book about distances, near and far. As she travels from Taos, New Mexico, to Shanghai, China and beyond, Pham meditates on the miles we are willing to cover to get away from ourselves, or those who hurt us, and the impossible gaps that can exist between two people sharing a bed. Pop Song is a book about all the routes by which we might escape our own needs before finally finding a way home. There is heartache in these pages, but Pham\u0027s electric ways of seeing create a perfectly fractured portrait of modern intimacy that is triumphant in both its vulnerability and restlessness. \"Each of the essays in this debut collection reads like a mini-memoir ... in which the author reflects on her experiences of young love, trauma, and transcendence through discussions of art and music ... with an intimacy that is at once tender and expansive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\" \u2014New York magazine\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e", "custom_clean": 1, "custom_lists": [{"id": 5, "sort": "Must Read.2021 Time", "value": "Must Read.2021 Time"}], "custom_lists_ids": "5", "custom_read_date": null, "custom_reading_list": 0, "custom_types": "eBook", "flags": 1, "has_cover": 1, "id": 133, "identifier_ids": "320,318,319", "identifiers": [{"book": 133, "id": 319, "name": "ISBN", "path": "https://www.worldcat.org/isbn/9781646220274", "sort": "isbn", "type": "isbn", "val": "9781646220274"}, {"book": 133, "id": 318, "name": "Google Books", "path": "https://books.google.com/books?id=V6UQEAAAQBAJ", "sort": "google", "type": "google", "val": "V6UQEAAAQBAJ"}, {"book": 133, "id": 320, "name": "Goodreads", "path": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/60057391", "sort": "goodreads", "type": "goodreads", "val": "60057391"}], "isbn": "9781646220274", "language_ids": "1", "languages": [{"avg_rating": 8.429245283018869, "count": 341, "id": 1, "name": "ENG", "sort": "ENG"}], "last_modified": "2023-05-04 17:55:52.136675+00:00", "order_by": "2022-10-05 15:54:11.131714+00:00", "path": "Larissa Pham/Pop Song_ Adventures in Art \u0026 Intim (133)", "pubdate": "2021-05-04", "publisher_ids": "77", "publishers": [{"avg_rating": 8.0, "count": 1, "id": 77, "name": "Catapult", "sort": "Catapult"}], "rating": 4, "series": [], "series_ids": null, "size": 1035488, "tag_ids": "44,49,92,132,133,194", "tags": [{"avg_rating": 8.89655172413793, "count": 51, "id": 49, "name": "Contemporary", "sort": 51}, {"avg_rating": 8.333333333333334, "count": 40, "id": 194, "name": "Time", "sort": 40}, {"avg_rating": 8.222222222222221, "count": 31, "id": 92, "name": "Biography", "sort": 31}, {"avg_rating": 8.0, "count": 6, "id": 44, "name": "Art", "sort": 6}, {"avg_rating": 7.6, "count": 6, "id": 132, "name": "Music", "sort": 6}, {"avg_rating": 8.333333333333334, "count": 6, "id": 133, "name": "Feminism", "sort": 6}], "timestamp": "2022-10-05 15:54:11.131714+00:00", "title": "Pop Song: Adventures in Art \u0026 Intimacy"}, {"author_ids": "134", "authors": [{"avg_rating": 8.0, "count": 1, "id": 134, "name": "Louis Menand", "sort": "Menand, Louis"}], "comments": "\u003cdiv\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"An engrossing and impossibly wide-ranging project ...

It was also about ideas, in the broadest sense\u2014economic and political, artistic and personal. In The Free World, the acclaimed Pulitzer Prize\u2013winning scholar and critic Louis Menand tells the story of American culture in the pivotal years from the end of World War II to Vietnam and shows how changing economic, technological, and social forces put their mark on creations of the mind. How did elitism and an anti-totalitarian skepticism of passion and ideology give way to a new sensibility defined by freewheeling experimentation and loving the Beatles? How was the ideal of \u201cfreedom\u201d applied to causes that ranged from anti-communism and civil rights to radical acts of self-creation via art and even crime? With the wit and insight familiar to readers of The Metaphysical Club and his New Yorker essays, Menand takes us inside Hannah Arendt\u2019s Manhattan, the Paris of Jean-Paul Sartre and Simone de Beauvoir, Merce Cunningham and John Cage\u2019s residencies at North Carolina\u2019s Black Mountain College, and the Memphis studio where Sam Phillips and Elvis Presley created a new music for the American teenager. He examines the post war vogue for French existentialism, structuralism and post-structuralism, the rise of abstract expressionism and pop art, Allen Ginsberg\u2019s friendship with Lionel Trilling, James Baldwin\u2019s transformation into a Civil Right spokesman, Susan Sontag\u2019s challenges to the New York Intellectuals, the defeat of obscenity laws, and the rise of the New Hollywood. Stressing the rich flow of ideas across the Atlantic, he also shows how Europeans played a vital role in promoting and influencing American art and entertainment. By the end of the Vietnam era, the American government had lost the moral prestige it enjoyed at the end of the Second World War, but America\u2019s once-despised culture had become respected and adored. With unprecedented verve and range, this book explains how that happened.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e", "custom_clean": 1, "custom_lists": [{"id": 5, "sort": "Must Read.2021 Time", "value": "Must Read.2021 Time"}], "custom_lists_ids": "5", "custom_read_date": null, "custom_reading_list": 0, "custom_types": "eBook", "flags": 1, "has_cover": 1, "id": 132, "identifier_ids": "315,316,317", "identifiers": [{"book": 132, "id": 317, "name": "ISBN", "path": "https://www.worldcat.org/isbn/9780374722913", "sort": "isbn", "type": "isbn", "val": "9780374722913"}, {"book": 132, "id": 316, "name": "Google Books", "path": "https://books.google.com/books?id=rrziDwAAQBAJ", "sort": "google", "type": "google", "val": "rrziDwAAQBAJ"}, {"book": 132, "id": 315, "name": "Goodreads", "path": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/53317422", "sort": "goodreads", "type": "goodreads", "val": "53317422"}], "isbn": "9780374722913", "language_ids": "1", "languages": [{"avg_rating": 8.429245283018869, "count": 341, "id": 1, "name": "ENG", "sort": "ENG"}], "last_modified": "2023-05-04 17:55:52.136675+00:00", "order_by": "2022-10-05 15:54:10.771659+00:00", "path": "Louis Menand/The Free World_ Art and Thought in (132)", "pubdate": "2021-04-20", "publisher_ids": "71", "publishers": [{"avg_rating": 8.0, "count": 4, "id": 71, "name": "Farrar, Straus and Giroux", "sort": "Farrar, Straus and Giroux"}], "rating": 4, "series": [], "series_ids": null, "size": 35444855, "tag_ids": "44,57,60,62,132,194", "tags": [{"avg_rating": 8.333333333333334, "count": 40, "id": 194, "name": "Time", "sort": 40}, {"avg_rating": 8.363636363636363, "count": 24, "id": 60, "name": "History", "sort": 24}, {"avg_rating": 8.347826086956522, "count": 23, "id": 57, "name": "Politics", "sort": 23}, {"avg_rating": 7.833333333333333, "count": 12, "id": 62, "name": "Philosophy", "sort": 12}, {"avg_rating": 8.0, "count": 6, "id": 44, "name": "Art", "sort": 6}, {"avg_rating": 7.6, "count": 6, "id": 132, "name": "Music", "sort": 6}], "timestamp": "2022-10-05 15:54:10.771659+00:00", "title": "The Free World: Art and Thought in the Cold War"}, {"author_ids": "133,153", "authors": [{"avg_rating": 8.0, "count": 1, "id": 133, "name": "Melissa Febos", "sort": "Febos, Melissa"}, {"avg_rating": 8.0, "count": 1, "id": 153, "name": "Forsyth Harmon", "sort": "Harmon, Forsyth"}], "comments": "\u003cdiv\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA gripping set of stories about the forces that shape girls and the adults they become.

Next he directed four consecutive hit plays, won back-to-back Tonys, ushered in a new era of Hollywood moviemaking with Who\u0027s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?, and followed it with The Graduate, which won him an Oscar and became the third-highest-grossing movie ever.

It would take decades for him to come to grips with his demons. In an incomparable portrait that follows Nichols from Berlin to New York to Chicago to Hollywood, Mark Harris explores, with brilliantly vivid detail and insight, the life, work, struggle, and passion of an artist and man in constant motion. Among the 250 people Harris interviewed: Elaine May, Meryl Streep, Stephen Sondheim, Robert Redford, Glenn Close, Tom Hanks, Candice Bergen, Emma Thompson, Annette Bening, Natalie Portman, Julia Roberts, Lorne Michaels, and Gloria Steinem.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMark Harris gives an intimate and evenhanded accounting of success and failure alike; the portrait is not always flattering, but its ultimate impact is to present the full story of one of the most richly interesting, complicated, and consequential figures the worlds of theater and motion pictures have ever seen.

Just as she and her family settled into a new home, her father would tell them it was time to say their goodbyes. The instability wrought by Nadia\u2019s nomadic childhood was deepened by family secrets and fractures, both lived and inherited. Her Armenian American mother, who abandoned Nadia when she was two, would periodically reappear, only to vanish again. Her father, a Ghanaian, the great hero of her life, died when she was thirteen. After his passing, Nadia\u2019s stepmother weighed her down with a revelation that was either a bombshell secret or a lie, rife with shaming innuendo. With these and other ruptures, Nadia arrived in New York as a young woman feeling stateless, motherless, and uncertain about her future, yet eager to find her own identity. What followed, however, were periods of depression in which she struggled to hold herself and her siblings together. \u201cA magnificent, complex assessment of selfhood and why it matters\u201d (Elle), Aftershocks depicts the way she hauled herself from the wreckage of her life\u2019s perpetual quaking, the means by which she has finally come to understand that the only ground firm enough to count on is the one written into existence by her own hand. \u201cFull of narrative risk and untrammeled lyricism\u201d (The Washington Post), Aftershocks joins the likes of Don\u2019t Let\u2019s Go to the Dogs Tonight and William Styron\u2019s Darkness Visible, and does for race identity what Maggie Nelson does for gender identity in The Argonauts.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e", "custom_clean": 1, "custom_lists": [{"id": 5, "sort": "Must Read.2021 Time", "value": "Must Read.2021 Time"}], "custom_lists_ids": "5", "custom_read_date": null, "custom_reading_list": 0, "custom_types": "eBook", "flags": 1, "has_cover": 1, "id": 127, "identifier_ids": "415,416", "identifiers": [{"book": 127, "id": 416, "name": "ISBN", "path": "https://www.worldcat.org/isbn/9781982111236", "sort": "isbn", "type": "isbn", "val": "9781982111236"}, {"book": 127, "id": 415, "name": "Google Books", "path": "https://books.google.com/books?id=VBQ3EAAAQBAJ", "sort": "google", "type": "google", "val": "VBQ3EAAAQBAJ"}], "isbn": "9781982111236", "language_ids": "1", "languages": [{"avg_rating": 8.429245283018869, "count": 341, "id": 1, "name": "ENG", "sort": "ENG"}], "last_modified": "2023-05-04 17:55:52.136675+00:00", "order_by": "2022-10-05 15:54:08.709178+00:00", "path": "Nadia Owusu/Aftershocks_ A Memoir (127)", "pubdate": "2021-08-03", "publisher_ids": "22", "publishers": [{"avg_rating": 8.0, "count": 8, "id": 22, "name": "Simon \u0026 Schuster", "sort": "Simon \u0026 Schuster"}], "rating": null, "series": [], "series_ids": null, "size": 3951047, "tag_ids": "92,119,120,150,194,331", "tags": [{"avg_rating": 8.333333333333334, "count": 40, "id": 194, "name": "Time", "sort": 40}, {"avg_rating": 8.222222222222221, "count": 31, "id": 92, "name": "Biography", "sort": 31}, {"avg_rating": 10.0, "count": 5, "id": 331, "name": "Girls \u0026 Women", "sort": 5}, {"avg_rating": 10.0, "count": 2, "id": 119, "name": "Ethnic \u0026 Regional", "sort": 2}, {"avg_rating": 10.0, "count": 2, "id": 120, "name": "African American \u0026 Black", "sort": 2}, {"avg_rating": null, "count": 1, "id": 150, "name": "Cultural", "sort": 1}], "timestamp": "2022-10-05 15:54:08.709178+00:00", "title": "Aftershocks: A Memoir"}, {"author_ids": "128", "authors": [{"avg_rating": 8.0, "count": 1, "id": 128, "name": "Nicole Eustace", "sort": "Eustace, Nicole"}], "comments": "\u003cdiv\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the eve of a major treaty conference between Iroquois leaders and European colonists in the distant summer of 1722, two white fur traders attacked an Indigenous hunter and left him for dead near Conestoga, Pennsylvania. Though virtually forgotten today, this act of brutality set into motion a remarkable series of criminal investigations and cross-cultural negotiations that challenged the definition of justice in early America.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn Covered with Night , leading historian Nicole Eustace reconstructs the crime and its aftermath, bringing us into the overlapping worlds of white colonists and Indigenous peoples in this formative period. As she shows, the murder of the Indigenous man set the entire mid-Atlantic on edge, with many believing war was imminent. Isolated killings often flared into colonial wars in North America, and colonists now anticipated a vengeful Indigenous uprising. Frantic efforts to resolve the case ignited a dramatic, far-reaching debate between Native American forms of justice\u2014centered on community, forgiveness, and reparations\u2014and an ideology of harsh reprisal, unique to the colonies and based on British law, which called for the killers\u2019 swift execution.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn charting the far-reaching ramifications of the murder, Covered with Night \u2014a phrase from Iroquois mourning practices\u2014overturns persistent assumptions about \u201ccivilized\u201d Europeans and \u201csavage\u201d Native Americans. As Eustace powerfully contends, the colonial obsession with \u201ccivility\u201d belied the reality that the Iroquois, far from being the barbarians of the white imagination, acted under a mantle of sophistication and humanity as they tried to make the land- and power-hungry colonials understand their ways. In truth, Eustace reveals, the Iroquois\u2014the Six Nations of the Haudenosaunee, as they are known today\u2014saw the killing as an opportunity to forge stronger bonds with the colonists. They argued for restorative justice and for reconciliation between the two sides, even as they mourned the deceased.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn absorbing chronicle built around an extraordinary group of characters\u2014from the slain man\u2019s resilient widow to the Indigenous diplomat known as \u201cCaptain Civility\u201d to the scheming governor of Pennsylvania\u2014 Covered with Night transforms a single event into an unforgettable portrait of early America.

Rejecting the futile modern fixation on \u201cgetting everything done,\u201d Four Thousand Weeks introduces readers to tools for constructing a meaningful life by embracing finitude, showing how many of the unhelpful ways we\u2019ve come to think about time aren\u2019t inescapable, unchanging truths, but choices we\u2019ve made as individuals and as a society\u2014and that we could do things differently.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e", "custom_clean": 1, "custom_lists": [{"id": 5, "sort": "Must Read.2021 Time", "value": "Must Read.2021 Time"}], "custom_lists_ids": "5", "custom_read_date": null, "custom_reading_list": 0, "custom_types": "eBook", "flags": 1, "has_cover": 1, "id": 125, "identifier_ids": "411,410,409", "identifiers": [{"book": 125, "id": 409, "name": "ISBN", "path": "https://www.worldcat.org/isbn/9780374159122", "sort": "isbn", "type": "isbn", "val": "9780374159122"}, {"book": 125, "id": 410, "name": "Google Books", "path": "https://books.google.com/books?id=5my-zQEACAAJ", "sort": "google", "type": "google", "val": "5my-zQEACAAJ"}, {"book": 125, "id": 411, "name": "Goodreads", "path": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/54785515", "sort": "goodreads", "type": "goodreads", "val": "54785515"}], "isbn": "9780374159122", "language_ids": "1", "languages": [{"avg_rating": 8.429245283018869, "count": 341, "id": 1, "name": "ENG", "sort": "ENG"}], "last_modified": "2023-05-04 17:55:52.136675+00:00", "order_by": "2022-10-05 15:54:07.946195+00:00", "path": "Oliver Burkeman/Four Thousand Weeks_ Time Managemen (125)", "pubdate": "2021-08-10", "publisher_ids": "71", "publishers": [{"avg_rating": 8.0, "count": 4, "id": 71, "name": "Farrar, Straus and Giroux", "sort": "Farrar, Straus and Giroux"}], "rating": 4, "series": [], "series_ids": null, "size": 729503, "tag_ids": "31,43,51,62,70,194", "tags": [{"avg_rating": 8.333333333333334, "count": 40, "id": 194, "name": "Time", "sort": 40}, {"avg_rating": 8.0, "count": 27, "id": 43, "name": "Self Help", "sort": 27}, {"avg_rating": 8.0, "count": 20, "id": 31, "name": "Psychology", "sort": 20}, {"avg_rating": 7.833333333333333, "count": 12, "id": 62, "name": "Philosophy", "sort": 12}, {"avg_rating": 8.2, "count": 11, "id": 51, "name": "Business", "sort": 11}, {"avg_rating": 8.0, "count": 7, "id": 70, "name": "Health", "sort": 7}], "timestamp": "2022-10-05 15:54:07.946195+00:00", "title": "Four Thousand Weeks: Time Management for Mortals"}, {"author_ids": "126", "authors": [{"avg_rating": 10.0, "count": 1, "id": 126, "name": "Patrick Radden Keefe", "sort": "Keefe, Patrick Radden"}], "comments": "\u003cdiv\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNATIONAL BOOK CRITICS CIRCLE NOMINEE \u2022 A NEW YORK TIMES NOTABLE\u00a0BOOK OF THE YEAR \u2022 NEW YORK TIMES BEST SELLER \u2022 A grand, devastating portrait of three generations of the Sackler family, famed for their philanthropy, whose fortune was built by Valium and whose reputation was destroyed by OxyContin. From the prize-winning and bestselling author of Say Nothing The history of the Sackler dynasty is rife with drama\u2014baroque personal lives; bitter disputes over estates; fistfights in boardrooms; glittering art collections; Machiavellian courtroom maneuvers; and the calculated use of money to burnish reputations and crush the less powerful.\u00a0The Sackler name has adorned the walls of many storied institutions\u2014Harvard, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Oxford, the Louvre. They are one of the richest families in the world, known for their lavish donations to the arts and the sciences. The source of the family fortune was vague, however, until it emerged that the Sacklers were responsible for making and marketing a blockbuster painkiller that was the catalyst for the opioid crisis. Empire of Pain begins with the story of three doctor brothers, Raymond, Mortimer and the incalculably energetic Arthur, who weathered the poverty of the Great Depression and appalling anti-Semitism. Working at a barbaric mental institution, Arthur saw a better way and conducted groundbreaking research into drug treatments. He also had a genius for marketing, especially for pharmaceuticals, and bought a small ad firm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eArthur devised the marketing for Valium, and built the first great Sackler fortune. He purchased a drug manufacturer, Purdue Frederick, which would be run by Raymond and Mortimer. The brothers began collecting art, and wives, and grand residences in exotic locales. Their children and grandchildren grew up in luxury.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eForty years later, Raymond\u2019s son Richard ran the family-owned Purdue. The template Arthur Sackler created to sell Valium\u2014co-opting doctors, influencing the FDA, downplaying the drug\u2019s addictiveness\u2014was employed to launch a far more potent product: OxyContin. The drug went on to generate some thirty-five billion dollars in revenue, and to launch a public health crisis in which hundreds of thousands would die. This is the saga of three generations of a single family and the mark they would leave on the world, a tale that moves from the bustling streets of early twentieth-century Brooklyn to the seaside palaces\u00a0of Greenwich, Connecticut, and Cap d\u2019Antibes to the corridors of power in Washington, D.C.\u00a0 Empire of Pain chronicles the multiple investigations of the Sacklers and their company, and the scorched-earth legal tactics that the family has used to evade accountability.\u00a0Empire of Pain is a masterpiece of narrative reporting and writing, exhaustively documented and ferociously compelling. It is a portrait of the excesses of America\u2019s second Gilded Age, a study of impunity among the super elite and a relentless investigation of the naked greed and indifference to human suffering that built one of the world\u2019s great fortunes.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e", "custom_clean": 1, "custom_lists": [{"id": 5, "sort": "Must Read.2021 Time", "value": "Must Read.2021 Time"}], "custom_lists_ids": "5", "custom_read_date": null, "custom_reading_list": 0, "custom_types": "eBook", "flags": 1, "has_cover": 1, "id": 124, "identifier_ids": "408,406,407", "identifiers": [{"book": 124, "id": 407, "name": "ISBN", "path": "https://www.worldcat.org/isbn/9780385545693", "sort": "isbn", "type": "isbn", "val": "9780385545693"}, {"book": 124, "id": 406, "name": "Google Books", "path": "https://books.google.com/books?id=Qb4IEAAAQBAJ", "sort": "google", "type": "google", "val": "Qb4IEAAAQBAJ"}, {"book": 124, "id": 408, "name": "Goodreads", "path": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43868109", "sort": "goodreads", "type": "goodreads", "val": "43868109"}], "isbn": "9780385545693", "language_ids": "1", "languages": [{"avg_rating": 8.429245283018869, "count": 341, "id": 1, "name": "ENG", "sort": "ENG"}], "last_modified": "2023-05-04 17:55:52.136675+00:00", "order_by": "2022-10-05 15:54:07.602947+00:00", "path": "Patrick Radden Keefe/Empire of Pain_ The Secret History (124)", "pubdate": "2021-04-13", "publisher_ids": "82", "publishers": [{"avg_rating": 8.5, "count": 5, "id": 82, "name": "Knopf Publishing Group", "sort": "Knopf Publishing Group"}], "rating": 5, "series": [], "series_ids": null, "size": 5759595, "tag_ids": "51,57,58,60,92,194", "tags": [{"avg_rating": 8.333333333333334, "count": 40, "id": 194, "name": "Time", "sort": 40}, {"avg_rating": 8.222222222222221, "count": 31, "id": 92, "name": "Biography", "sort": 31}, {"avg_rating": 8.363636363636363, "count": 24, "id": 60, "name": "History", "sort": 24}, {"avg_rating": 8.347826086956522, "count": 23, "id": 57, "name": "Politics", "sort": 23}, {"avg_rating": 8.2, "count": 11, "id": 51, "name": "Business", "sort": 11}, {"avg_rating": 8.222222222222221, "count": 11, "id": 58, "name": "Science", "sort": 11}], "timestamp": "2022-10-05 15:54:07.602947+00:00", "title": "Empire of Pain: The Secret History of the Sackler Dynasty"}, {"author_ids": "125", "authors": [{"avg_rating": 8.0, "count": 1, "id": 125, "name": "Viet Thanh Nguyen", "sort": "Nguyen, Viet Thanh"}], "comments": "\u003cdiv\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sequel to The Sympathizer, which won the 2016 Pulitzer Prize in Fiction and went on to sell over a million copies worldwide, The Committed tells the story of \u201cthe man of two minds\u201d as he comes as a refugee to France and turns his hand to capitalism\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe long-awaited follow-up to the Pulitzer Prize-winning The Sympathizer, which has sold more than one million copies worldwide, The Committed follows the man of two minds as he arrives in Paris in the early 1980s with his blood brother Bon.

Now, in this illuminating, deeply moving book inspired by Rose\u2019s gift to Ashley, historian Tiya Miles carefully unearths these women\u2019s faint presence in archival records to follow the paths of their lives\u2014and the lives of so many women like them\u2014to write a singular and revelatory history of the experience of slavery, and the uncertain freedom afterward, in the United States.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe search to uncover this history is part of the story itself. For where the historical record falls short of capturing Rose\u2019s, Ashley\u2019s, and Ruth\u2019s full lives, Miles turns to objects and to art as equally important sources, assembling a chorus of women\u2019s and families\u2019 stories and critiquing the scant archives that for decades have overlooked so many. The contents of Ashley\u2019s sack\u2014a tattered dress, handfuls of pecans, a braid of hair, \u201cmy Love always\u201d\u2014are eloquent evidence of the lives these women lived.

Childhood tells the story of a misfit child\u0027s single-minded determination to become a poet; Youth describes her early experiences of sex, work, and independence. Dependency picks up the story as the narrator embarks on the first of her four marriages and goes on to describe her horrible descent into drug addiction, enabled by her sinister, gaslighting doctor-husband.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThroughout, the narrator grapples with the tension between her vocation as a writer and her competing roles as daughter, wife, mother, and drug addict, and she writes about female experience and identity in a way that feels very fresh and pertinent to today\u0027s discussions around feminism. Ditlevsen\u0027s trilogy is remarkable for its intensity and its immersive depiction of a world of complex female friendships, family and growing up--in this sense, it\u0027s Copenhagen\u0027s answer to Elena Ferrante\u0027s Neapolitan Novels. She can also be seen as a spiritual forerunner of confessional writers like Karl Ove Knausgaard, Annie Ernaux, Rachel Cusk and Deborah Levy.

Beginning in his hometown of New Orleans, Clint Smith leads the reader on an unforgettable tour of monuments and landmarks--those that are honest about the past and those that are not--that offer an intergenerational story of how slavery has been central in shaping our nation\u0027s collective history, and ourselves. It is the story of the Monticello Plantation in Virginia, the estate where Thomas Jefferson wrote letters espousing the urgent need for liberty while enslaving more than four hundred people. It is the story of the Whitney Plantation, one of the only former plantations devoted to preserving the experience of the enslaved people whose lives and work sustained it. It is the story of Angola, a former plantation-turned-maximum-security prison in Louisiana that is filled with Black men who work across the 18,000-acre land for virtually no pay. And it is the story of Blandford Cemetery, the final resting place of tens of thousands of Confederate soldiers. A deeply researched and transporting exploration of the legacy of slavery and its imprint on centuries of American history, How the Word Is Passed illustrates how some of our country\u0027s most essential stories are hidden in plain view--whether in places we might drive by on our way to work, holidays such as Juneteenth, or entire neighborhoods like downtown Manhattan, where the brutal history of the trade in enslaved men, women, and children has been deeply imprinted. Informed by scholarship and brought to life by the story of people living today, Smith\u0027s debut work of nonfiction is a landmark of reflection and insight that offers a new understanding of the hopeful role that memory and history can play in making sense of our country and how it has come to be.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e", "custom_clean": 1, "custom_lists": [{"id": 5, "sort": "Must Read.2021 Time", "value": "Must Read.2021 Time"}], "custom_lists_ids": "5", "custom_read_date": null, "custom_reading_list": 0, "custom_types": "eBook", "flags": 1, "has_cover": 1, "id": 113, "identifier_ids": "374,376,375,377", "identifiers": [{"book": 113, "id": 377, "name": "ISBN", "path": "https://www.worldcat.org/isbn/9780316492935", "sort": "isbn", "type": "isbn", "val": "9780316492935"}, {"book": 113, "id": 375, "name": "Google Books", "path": "https://books.google.com/books?id=8pEHzgEACAAJ", "sort": "google", "type": "google", "val": "8pEHzgEACAAJ"}, {"book": 113, "id": 376, "name": "Goodreads", "path": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/55643287", "sort": "goodreads", "type": "goodreads", "val": "55643287"}, {"book": 113, "id": 374, "name": "Amazon", "path": "https://amazon.com/dp/0316492930", "sort": "amazon", "type": "amazon", "val": "0316492930"}], "isbn": "9780316492935", "language_ids": "1", "languages": [{"avg_rating": 8.429245283018869, "count": 341, "id": 1, "name": "ENG", "sort": "ENG"}], "last_modified": "2023-05-04 17:55:52.136675+00:00", "order_by": "2022-10-05 15:54:03.677102+00:00", "path": "Clint Smith/How the Word Is Passed_ A Reckoning (113)", "pubdate": "2021-06-01", "publisher_ids": "68", "publishers": [{"avg_rating": 8.5, "count": 4, "id": 68, "name": "Little, Brown and Company", "sort": "Little, Brown and Company"}], "rating": 5, "series": [], "series_ids": null, "size": 568333, "tag_ids": "57,60,194", "tags": [{"avg_rating": 8.333333333333334, "count": 40, "id": 194, "name": "Time", "sort": 40}, {"avg_rating": 8.363636363636363, "count": 24, "id": 60, "name": "History", "sort": 24}, {"avg_rating": 8.347826086956522, "count": 23, "id": 57, "name": "Politics", "sort": 23}], "timestamp": "2022-10-05 15:54:03.677102+00:00", "title": "How the Word Is Passed: A Reckoning With the History of Slavery Across America"}, {"author_ids": "114", "authors": [{"avg_rating": 10.0, "count": 1, "id": 114, "name": "Andrea Elliott", "sort": "Elliott, Andrea"}], "comments": "\u003cdiv\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn Invisible Child, Pulitzer Prize winner Andrea Elliott follows eight dramatic years in the life of Dasani, a girl whose imagination is as soaring as the skyscrapers near her Brooklyn shelter.

This is a riveting investigation of infectious disease, poverty, racism, and for-profit health care\u2014and the harm caused by decades of silence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrowing up in a New Jersey factory town in the 1980s, Daisy Hern\u00e1ndez believed that her aunt had become deathly ill from eating an apple. No one in her family, in either the United States or Colombia, spoke of infectious diseases, and even into her thirties, she only knew that her aunt had died of a rare illness called Chagas. But as Hern\u00e1ndez dug deeper, she discovered that Chagas\u2014or the kissing bug disease\u2014is more prevalent in the United States than the Zika virus. Today, more than three hundred thousand Americans have Chagas.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy do some infectious diseases make headlines and others fall by the wayside? After her aunt\u0027s death, Hern\u00e1ndez begins searching for answers about who our nation chooses to take care of and who we ignore. Crisscrossing the country, she interviews patients, epidemiologists, and even veterinarians with the Department of Defense. She learns that outside of Latin America, the United States is the only country with the native insects\u2014the \"kissing bugs\"\u2014that carry the Chagas parasite. She spends a night in southwest Texas hunting the dreaded bug with university researchers.

Sullivan, Jr., Washington Post From one of our top historians, a groundbreaking story of policing and \u201criots\u201d that shatters our understanding of the post\u2013civil rights era. What began in spring 2020 as local protests in response to the killing of George Floyd by Minneapolis police quickly exploded into a massive nationwide movement. Millions of mostly young people defiantly flooded into the nation\u2019s streets, demanding an end to police brutality and to the broader, systemic repression of Black people and other people of color. To many observers, the protests appeared to be without precedent in their scale and persistence. Yet, as the acclaimed historian Elizabeth Hinton demonstrates in America on Fire, the events of 2020 had clear precursors\u2014and any attempt to understand our current crisis requires a reckoning with the recent past. Even in the aftermath of Donald Trump, many Americans consider the decades since the civil rights movement in the mid-1960s as a story of progress toward greater inclusiveness and equality. Hinton\u2019s sweeping narrative uncovers an altogether different history, taking us on a troubling journey from Detroit in 1967 and Miami in 1980 to Los Angeles in 1992 and beyond to chart the persistence of structural racism and one of its primary consequences, the so-called urban riot. Hinton offers a critical corrective: the word riot was nothing less than a racist trope applied to events that can only be properly understood as rebellions\u2014explosions of collective resistance to an unequal and violent order. As she suggests, if rebellion and the conditions that precipitated it never disappeared, the optimistic story of a post\u2013Jim Crow United States no longer holds. Black rebellion, America on Fire powerfully illustrates, was born in response to poverty and exclusion, but most immediately in reaction to police violence. In 1968, President Lyndon Johnson launched the \u201cWar on Crime,\u201d sending militarized police forces into impoverished Black neighborhoods. Facing increasing surveillance and brutality, residents threw rocks and Molotov cocktails at officers, plundered local businesses, and vandalized exploitative institutions. Hinton draws on exclusive sources to uncover a previously hidden geography of violence in smaller American cities, from York, Pennsylvania, to Cairo, Illinois, to Stockton, California. The central lesson from these eruptions\u2014that police violence invariably leads to community violence\u2014continues to escape policymakers, who respond by further criminalizing entire groups instead of addressing underlying socioeconomic causes. The results are the hugely expanded policing and prison regimes that shape the lives of so many Americans today. Presenting a new framework for understanding our nation\u2019s enduring strife, America on Fire is also a warning: rebellions will surely continue unless police are no longer called on to manage the consequences of dismal conditions beyond their control, and until an oppressive system is finally remade on the principles of justice and equality.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e", "custom_clean": 1, "custom_lists": [{"id": 5, "sort": "Must Read.2021 Time", "value": "Must Read.2021 Time"}], "custom_lists_ids": "5", "custom_read_date": null, "custom_reading_list": 0, "custom_types": "eBook", "flags": 1, "has_cover": 1, "id": 144, "identifier_ids": "351,352,353", "identifiers": [{"book": 144, "id": 353, "name": "ISBN", "path": "https://www.worldcat.org/isbn/9781631498916", "sort": "isbn", "type": "isbn", "val": "9781631498916"}, {"book": 144, "id": 352, "name": "Google Books", "path": "https://books.google.com/books?id=PAwDEAAAQBAJ", "sort": "google", "type": "google", "val": "PAwDEAAAQBAJ"}, {"book": 144, "id": 351, "name": "Goodreads", "path": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/55298326", "sort": "goodreads", "type": "goodreads", "val": "55298326"}], "isbn": "9781631498916", "language_ids": "1", "languages": [{"avg_rating": 8.429245283018869, "count": 341, "id": 1, "name": "ENG", "sort": "ENG"}], "last_modified": "2023-05-04 17:55:52.136675+00:00", "order_by": "2022-10-05 15:54:15.142378+00:00", "path": "Elizabeth Hinton/America on Fire_ The Untold History (144)", "pubdate": "2021-05-18", "publisher_ids": "84", "publishers": [{"avg_rating": 8.0, "count": 4, "id": 84, "name": "Liveright Publishing", "sort": "Liveright Publishing"}], "rating": 4, "series": [], "series_ids": null, "size": 12900649, "tag_ids": "57,60,194", "tags": [{"avg_rating": 8.333333333333334, "count": 40, "id": 194, "name": "Time", "sort": 40}, {"avg_rating": 8.363636363636363, "count": 24, "id": 60, "name": "History", "sort": 24}, {"avg_rating": 8.347826086956522, "count": 23, "id": 57, "name": "Politics", "sort": 23}], "timestamp": "2022-10-05 15:54:15.142378+00:00", "title": "America on Fire: The Untold History of Police Violence and Black Rebellion Since the 1960s"}, {"author_ids": "145", "authors": [{"avg_rating": 8.0, "count": 1, "id": 145, "name": "Elizabeth Kolbert", "sort": "Kolbert, Elizabeth"}], "comments": "\u003cdiv\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNATIONAL BESTSELLER * The Pulitzer Prize-winning author of The Sixth Extinction returns to humanity\u0027s transformative impact on the environment, now asking: After doing so much damage, can we change nature, this time to save it?

So pervasive are human impacts on the planet that it\u0027s said we live in a new geological epoch: the Anthropocene. In Under a White Sky, Elizabeth Kolbert takes a hard look at the new world we are creating. Along the way, she meets biologists who are trying to preserve the world\u0027s rarest fish, which lives in a single tiny pool in the middle of the Mojave; engineers who are turning carbon emissions to stone in Iceland; Australian researchers who are trying to develop a \"super coral\" that can survive on a hotter globe; and physicists who are contemplating shooting tiny diamonds into the stratosphere to cool the earth. One way to look at human civilization, says Kolbert, is as a ten-thousand-year exercise in defying nature. In The Sixth Extinction, she explored the ways in which our capacity for destruction has reshaped the natural world. Now she examines how the very sorts of interventions that have imperiled our planet are increasingly seen as the only hope for its salvation.

Others get to the bottom and decide they want to stay there. I don\u0027t want to get to the bottom because I\u0027m already drowning.

Nobody, including the lawmakers who passed the bill, expected it to transform the country\u2019s demographics. But over the next four decades, millions arrived, including Jay Caspian Kang\u2019s parents, grandparents, aunts, and uncles. They came with almost no understanding of their new home, much less the history of \u201cAsian America\u201d that was supposed to define them.\u00a0The Loneliest Americans is the unforgettable story of Kang and his family as they move from a housing project in Cambridge to an idyllic college town in the South and eventually to the West Coast. Their story unfolds against the backdrop of a rapidly expanding Asian America, as millions more immigrants, many of them working-class or undocumented, stream into the country. At the same time, upwardly mobile urban professionals have struggled to reconcile their parents\u2019 assimilationist goals with membership in a multicultural elite\u2014all while trying to carve out a new kind of belonging for their own children, who are neither white nor truly \u201cpeople of color.\u201d\u00a0Kang recognizes this existential loneliness in himself and in other Asian Americans who try to locate themselves in the country\u2019s racial binary. There are the businessmen turning Flushing into a center of immigrant wealth; the casualties of the Los Angeles riots; the impoverished parents in New York City who believe that admission to the city\u2019s exam schools is the only way out; the men\u2019s right\u2019s activists on Reddit ranting about intermarriage; and the handful of protesters who show up at Black Lives Matter rallies holding \u201cYellow Peril Supports Black Power\u201d signs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKang\u2019s exquisitely crafted book brings these lonely parallel climbers together and calls for a new immigrant solidarity\u2014one rooted not in bubble tea and elite college admissions but in the struggles of refugees and the working class.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e", "custom_clean": 1, "custom_lists": [{"id": 5, "sort": "Must Read.2021 Time", "value": "Must Read.2021 Time"}], "custom_lists_ids": "5", "custom_read_date": null, "custom_reading_list": 0, "custom_types": "eBook", "flags": 1, "has_cover": 1, "id": 137, "identifier_ids": "332,333,331", "identifiers": [{"book": 137, "id": 331, "name": "ISBN", "path": "https://www.worldcat.org/isbn/9780525576242", "sort": "isbn", "type": "isbn", "val": "9780525576242"}, {"book": 137, "id": 333, "name": "Google Books", "path": "https://books.google.com/books?id=vYMvEAAAQBAJ", "sort": "google", "type": "google", "val": "vYMvEAAAQBAJ"}, {"book": 137, "id": 332, "name": "Goodreads", "path": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/58145392", "sort": "goodreads", "type": "goodreads", "val": "58145392"}], "isbn": "9780525576242", "language_ids": "1", "languages": [{"avg_rating": 8.429245283018869, "count": 341, "id": 1, "name": "ENG", "sort": "ENG"}], "last_modified": "2023-05-04 17:55:52.136675+00:00", "order_by": "2022-10-05 15:54:12.577840+00:00", "path": "Jay Caspian Kang/The Loneliest Americans (137)", "pubdate": "2021-10-12", "publisher_ids": "100", "publishers": [{"avg_rating": 8.0, "count": 6, "id": 100, "name": "Crown Publishing Group", "sort": "Crown Publishing Group"}], "rating": 4, "series": [], "series_ids": null, "size": 1727399, "tag_ids": "57,60,92,194", "tags": [{"avg_rating": 8.333333333333334, "count": 40, "id": 194, "name": "Time", "sort": 40}, {"avg_rating": 8.222222222222221, "count": 31, "id": 92, "name": "Biography", "sort": 31}, {"avg_rating": 8.363636363636363, "count": 24, "id": 60, "name": "History", "sort": 24}, {"avg_rating": 8.347826086956522, "count": 23, "id": 57, "name": "Politics", "sort": 23}], "timestamp": "2022-10-05 15:54:12.577840+00:00", "title": "The Loneliest Americans"}, {"author_ids": "138", "authors": [{"avg_rating": 8.0, "count": 1, "id": 138, "name": "Jesse McCarthy", "sort": "McCarthy, Jesse"}], "comments": "\u003cdiv\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRanging from Ta-Nehisi Coates\u2019s case for reparations to Toni Morrison\u2019s revolutionary humanism to D\u2019Angelo\u2019s simmering blend of R and racial justice, Jesse McCarthy\u2019s bracing essays investigate with virtuosic intensity the art, music, literature, and political stances that have defined the twenty-first century.

One morning, when Kat was nine, her mother, a vivacious and mischievous woman, casually made a morbid joke: When she eventually dies, she said laughing, she\u0027d like to be stuffed and displayed in Kat\u0027s future apartment in order to always watch over her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFour years later when her mother dies unexpectedly from cancer, Kat, her two older sisters, and their father are plunged into a debilitating, lonely grief.

Pop Song is also a book about distances, near and far. As she travels from Taos, New Mexico, to Shanghai, China and beyond, Pham meditates on the miles we are willing to cover to get away from ourselves, or those who hurt us, and the impossible gaps that can exist between two people sharing a bed. Pop Song is a book about all the routes by which we might escape our own needs before finally finding a way home. There is heartache in these pages, but Pham\u0027s electric ways of seeing create a perfectly fractured portrait of modern intimacy that is triumphant in both its vulnerability and restlessness. \"Each of the essays in this debut collection reads like a mini-memoir ... in which the author reflects on her experiences of young love, trauma, and transcendence through discussions of art and music ... with an intimacy that is at once tender and expansive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\" \u2014New York magazine\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e", "custom_clean": 1, "custom_lists": [{"id": 5, "sort": "Must Read.2021 Time", "value": "Must Read.2021 Time"}], "custom_lists_ids": "5", "custom_read_date": null, "custom_reading_list": 0, "custom_types": "eBook", "flags": 1, "has_cover": 1, "id": 133, "identifier_ids": "320,318,319", "identifiers": [{"book": 133, "id": 319, "name": "ISBN", "path": "https://www.worldcat.org/isbn/9781646220274", "sort": "isbn", "type": "isbn", "val": "9781646220274"}, {"book": 133, "id": 318, "name": "Google Books", "path": "https://books.google.com/books?id=V6UQEAAAQBAJ", "sort": "google", "type": "google", "val": "V6UQEAAAQBAJ"}, {"book": 133, "id": 320, "name": "Goodreads", "path": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/60057391", "sort": "goodreads", "type": "goodreads", "val": "60057391"}], "isbn": "9781646220274", "language_ids": "1", "languages": [{"avg_rating": 8.429245283018869, "count": 341, "id": 1, "name": "ENG", "sort": "ENG"}], "last_modified": "2023-05-04 17:55:52.136675+00:00", "order_by": "2022-10-05 15:54:11.131714+00:00", "path": "Larissa Pham/Pop Song_ Adventures in Art \u0026 Intim (133)", "pubdate": "2021-05-04", "publisher_ids": "77", "publishers": [{"avg_rating": 8.0, "count": 1, "id": 77, "name": "Catapult", "sort": "Catapult"}], "rating": 4, "series": [], "series_ids": null, "size": 1035488, "tag_ids": "44,49,92,132,133,194", "tags": [{"avg_rating": 8.89655172413793, "count": 51, "id": 49, "name": "Contemporary", "sort": 51}, {"avg_rating": 8.333333333333334, "count": 40, "id": 194, "name": "Time", "sort": 40}, {"avg_rating": 8.222222222222221, "count": 31, "id": 92, "name": "Biography", "sort": 31}, {"avg_rating": 8.0, "count": 6, "id": 44, "name": "Art", "sort": 6}, {"avg_rating": 7.6, "count": 6, "id": 132, "name": "Music", "sort": 6}, {"avg_rating": 8.333333333333334, "count": 6, "id": 133, "name": "Feminism", "sort": 6}], "timestamp": "2022-10-05 15:54:11.131714+00:00", "title": "Pop Song: Adventures in Art \u0026 Intimacy"}, {"author_ids": "134", "authors": [{"avg_rating": 8.0, "count": 1, "id": 134, "name": "Louis Menand", "sort": "Menand, Louis"}], "comments": "\u003cdiv\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"An engrossing and impossibly wide-ranging project ...

It was also about ideas, in the broadest sense\u2014economic and political, artistic and personal. In The Free World, the acclaimed Pulitzer Prize\u2013winning scholar and critic Louis Menand tells the story of American culture in the pivotal years from the end of World War II to Vietnam and shows how changing economic, technological, and social forces put their mark on creations of the mind. How did elitism and an anti-totalitarian skepticism of passion and ideology give way to a new sensibility defined by freewheeling experimentation and loving the Beatles? How was the ideal of \u201cfreedom\u201d applied to causes that ranged from anti-communism and civil rights to radical acts of self-creation via art and even crime? With the wit and insight familiar to readers of The Metaphysical Club and his New Yorker essays, Menand takes us inside Hannah Arendt\u2019s Manhattan, the Paris of Jean-Paul Sartre and Simone de Beauvoir, Merce Cunningham and John Cage\u2019s residencies at North Carolina\u2019s Black Mountain College, and the Memphis studio where Sam Phillips and Elvis Presley created a new music for the American teenager. He examines the post war vogue for French existentialism, structuralism and post-structuralism, the rise of abstract expressionism and pop art, Allen Ginsberg\u2019s friendship with Lionel Trilling, James Baldwin\u2019s transformation into a Civil Right spokesman, Susan Sontag\u2019s challenges to the New York Intellectuals, the defeat of obscenity laws, and the rise of the New Hollywood. Stressing the rich flow of ideas across the Atlantic, he also shows how Europeans played a vital role in promoting and influencing American art and entertainment. By the end of the Vietnam era, the American government had lost the moral prestige it enjoyed at the end of the Second World War, but America\u2019s once-despised culture had become respected and adored. With unprecedented verve and range, this book explains how that happened.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e", "custom_clean": 1, "custom_lists": [{"id": 5, "sort": "Must Read.2021 Time", "value": "Must Read.2021 Time"}], "custom_lists_ids": "5", "custom_read_date": null, "custom_reading_list": 0, "custom_types": "eBook", "flags": 1, "has_cover": 1, "id": 132, "identifier_ids": "315,316,317", "identifiers": [{"book": 132, "id": 317, "name": "ISBN", "path": "https://www.worldcat.org/isbn/9780374722913", "sort": "isbn", "type": "isbn", "val": "9780374722913"}, {"book": 132, "id": 316, "name": "Google Books", "path": "https://books.google.com/books?id=rrziDwAAQBAJ", "sort": "google", "type": "google", "val": "rrziDwAAQBAJ"}, {"book": 132, "id": 315, "name": "Goodreads", "path": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/53317422", "sort": "goodreads", "type": "goodreads", "val": "53317422"}], "isbn": "9780374722913", "language_ids": "1", "languages": [{"avg_rating": 8.429245283018869, "count": 341, "id": 1, "name": "ENG", "sort": "ENG"}], "last_modified": "2023-05-04 17:55:52.136675+00:00", "order_by": "2022-10-05 15:54:10.771659+00:00", "path": "Louis Menand/The Free World_ Art and Thought in (132)", "pubdate": "2021-04-20", "publisher_ids": "71", "publishers": [{"avg_rating": 8.0, "count": 4, "id": 71, "name": "Farrar, Straus and Giroux", "sort": "Farrar, Straus and Giroux"}], "rating": 4, "series": [], "series_ids": null, "size": 35444855, "tag_ids": "44,57,60,62,132,194", "tags": [{"avg_rating": 8.333333333333334, "count": 40, "id": 194, "name": "Time", "sort": 40}, {"avg_rating": 8.363636363636363, "count": 24, "id": 60, "name": "History", "sort": 24}, {"avg_rating": 8.347826086956522, "count": 23, "id": 57, "name": "Politics", "sort": 23}, {"avg_rating": 7.833333333333333, "count": 12, "id": 62, "name": "Philosophy", "sort": 12}, {"avg_rating": 8.0, "count": 6, "id": 44, "name": "Art", "sort": 6}, {"avg_rating": 7.6, "count": 6, "id": 132, "name": "Music", "sort": 6}], "timestamp": "2022-10-05 15:54:10.771659+00:00", "title": "The Free World: Art and Thought in the Cold War"}, {"author_ids": "133,153", "authors": [{"avg_rating": 8.0, "count": 1, "id": 133, "name": "Melissa Febos", "sort": "Febos, Melissa"}, {"avg_rating": 8.0, "count": 1, "id": 153, "name": "Forsyth Harmon", "sort": "Harmon, Forsyth"}], "comments": "\u003cdiv\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA gripping set of stories about the forces that shape girls and the adults they become.

Next he directed four consecutive hit plays, won back-to-back Tonys, ushered in a new era of Hollywood moviemaking with Who\u0027s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?, and followed it with The Graduate, which won him an Oscar and became the third-highest-grossing movie ever.

It would take decades for him to come to grips with his demons. In an incomparable portrait that follows Nichols from Berlin to New York to Chicago to Hollywood, Mark Harris explores, with brilliantly vivid detail and insight, the life, work, struggle, and passion of an artist and man in constant motion. Among the 250 people Harris interviewed: Elaine May, Meryl Streep, Stephen Sondheim, Robert Redford, Glenn Close, Tom Hanks, Candice Bergen, Emma Thompson, Annette Bening, Natalie Portman, Julia Roberts, Lorne Michaels, and Gloria Steinem.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMark Harris gives an intimate and evenhanded accounting of success and failure alike; the portrait is not always flattering, but its ultimate impact is to present the full story of one of the most richly interesting, complicated, and consequential figures the worlds of theater and motion pictures have ever seen.

Just as she and her family settled into a new home, her father would tell them it was time to say their goodbyes. The instability wrought by Nadia\u2019s nomadic childhood was deepened by family secrets and fractures, both lived and inherited. Her Armenian American mother, who abandoned Nadia when she was two, would periodically reappear, only to vanish again. Her father, a Ghanaian, the great hero of her life, died when she was thirteen. After his passing, Nadia\u2019s stepmother weighed her down with a revelation that was either a bombshell secret or a lie, rife with shaming innuendo. With these and other ruptures, Nadia arrived in New York as a young woman feeling stateless, motherless, and uncertain about her future, yet eager to find her own identity. What followed, however, were periods of depression in which she struggled to hold herself and her siblings together. \u201cA magnificent, complex assessment of selfhood and why it matters\u201d (Elle), Aftershocks depicts the way she hauled herself from the wreckage of her life\u2019s perpetual quaking, the means by which she has finally come to understand that the only ground firm enough to count on is the one written into existence by her own hand. \u201cFull of narrative risk and untrammeled lyricism\u201d (The Washington Post), Aftershocks joins the likes of Don\u2019t Let\u2019s Go to the Dogs Tonight and William Styron\u2019s Darkness Visible, and does for race identity what Maggie Nelson does for gender identity in The Argonauts.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e", "custom_clean": 1, "custom_lists": [{"id": 5, "sort": "Must Read.2021 Time", "value": "Must Read.2021 Time"}], "custom_lists_ids": "5", "custom_read_date": null, "custom_reading_list": 0, "custom_types": "eBook", "flags": 1, "has_cover": 1, "id": 127, "identifier_ids": "415,416", "identifiers": [{"book": 127, "id": 416, "name": "ISBN", "path": "https://www.worldcat.org/isbn/9781982111236", "sort": "isbn", "type": "isbn", "val": "9781982111236"}, {"book": 127, "id": 415, "name": "Google Books", "path": "https://books.google.com/books?id=VBQ3EAAAQBAJ", "sort": "google", "type": "google", "val": "VBQ3EAAAQBAJ"}], "isbn": "9781982111236", "language_ids": "1", "languages": [{"avg_rating": 8.429245283018869, "count": 341, "id": 1, "name": "ENG", "sort": "ENG"}], "last_modified": "2023-05-04 17:55:52.136675+00:00", "order_by": "2022-10-05 15:54:08.709178+00:00", "path": "Nadia Owusu/Aftershocks_ A Memoir (127)", "pubdate": "2021-08-03", "publisher_ids": "22", "publishers": [{"avg_rating": 8.0, "count": 8, "id": 22, "name": "Simon \u0026 Schuster", "sort": "Simon \u0026 Schuster"}], "rating": null, "series": [], "series_ids": null, "size": 3951047, "tag_ids": "92,119,120,150,194,331", "tags": [{"avg_rating": 8.333333333333334, "count": 40, "id": 194, "name": "Time", "sort": 40}, {"avg_rating": 8.222222222222221, "count": 31, "id": 92, "name": "Biography", "sort": 31}, {"avg_rating": 10.0, "count": 5, "id": 331, "name": "Girls \u0026 Women", "sort": 5}, {"avg_rating": 10.0, "count": 2, "id": 119, "name": "Ethnic \u0026 Regional", "sort": 2}, {"avg_rating": 10.0, "count": 2, "id": 120, "name": "African American \u0026 Black", "sort": 2}, {"avg_rating": null, "count": 1, "id": 150, "name": "Cultural", "sort": 1}], "timestamp": "2022-10-05 15:54:08.709178+00:00", "title": "Aftershocks: A Memoir"}, {"author_ids": "128", "authors": [{"avg_rating": 8.0, "count": 1, "id": 128, "name": "Nicole Eustace", "sort": "Eustace, Nicole"}], "comments": "\u003cdiv\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the eve of a major treaty conference between Iroquois leaders and European colonists in the distant summer of 1722, two white fur traders attacked an Indigenous hunter and left him for dead near Conestoga, Pennsylvania. Though virtually forgotten today, this act of brutality set into motion a remarkable series of criminal investigations and cross-cultural negotiations that challenged the definition of justice in early America.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn Covered with Night , leading historian Nicole Eustace reconstructs the crime and its aftermath, bringing us into the overlapping worlds of white colonists and Indigenous peoples in this formative period. As she shows, the murder of the Indigenous man set the entire mid-Atlantic on edge, with many believing war was imminent. Isolated killings often flared into colonial wars in North America, and colonists now anticipated a vengeful Indigenous uprising. Frantic efforts to resolve the case ignited a dramatic, far-reaching debate between Native American forms of justice\u2014centered on community, forgiveness, and reparations\u2014and an ideology of harsh reprisal, unique to the colonies and based on British law, which called for the killers\u2019 swift execution.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn charting the far-reaching ramifications of the murder, Covered with Night \u2014a phrase from Iroquois mourning practices\u2014overturns persistent assumptions about \u201ccivilized\u201d Europeans and \u201csavage\u201d Native Americans. As Eustace powerfully contends, the colonial obsession with \u201ccivility\u201d belied the reality that the Iroquois, far from being the barbarians of the white imagination, acted under a mantle of sophistication and humanity as they tried to make the land- and power-hungry colonials understand their ways. In truth, Eustace reveals, the Iroquois\u2014the Six Nations of the Haudenosaunee, as they are known today\u2014saw the killing as an opportunity to forge stronger bonds with the colonists. They argued for restorative justice and for reconciliation between the two sides, even as they mourned the deceased.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn absorbing chronicle built around an extraordinary group of characters\u2014from the slain man\u2019s resilient widow to the Indigenous diplomat known as \u201cCaptain Civility\u201d to the scheming governor of Pennsylvania\u2014 Covered with Night transforms a single event into an unforgettable portrait of early America.

From the prize-winning and bestselling author of Say Nothing The history of the Sackler dynasty is rife with drama\u2014baroque personal lives; bitter disputes over estates; fistfights in boardrooms; glittering art collections; Machiavellian courtroom maneuvers; and the calculated use of money to burnish reputations and crush the less powerful.\u00a0The Sackler name has adorned the walls of many storied institutions\u2014Harvard, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Oxford, the Louvre. They are one of the richest families in the world, known for their lavish donations to the arts and the sciences. The source of the family fortune was vague, however, until it emerged that the Sacklers were responsible for making and marketing a blockbuster painkiller that was the catalyst for the opioid crisis. Empire of Pain begins with the story of three doctor brothers, Raymond, Mortimer and the incalculably energetic Arthur, who weathered the poverty of the Great Depression and appalling anti-Semitism. Working at a barbaric mental institution, Arthur saw a better way and conducted groundbreaking research into drug treatments. He also had a genius for marketing, especially for pharmaceuticals, and bought a small ad firm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eArthur devised the marketing for Valium, and built the first great Sackler fortune. He purchased a drug manufacturer, Purdue Frederick, which would be run by Raymond and Mortimer. The brothers began collecting art, and wives, and grand residences in exotic locales. Their children and grandchildren grew up in luxury.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eForty years later, Raymond\u2019s son Richard ran the family-owned Purdue. The template Arthur Sackler created to sell Valium\u2014co-opting doctors, influencing the FDA, downplaying the drug\u2019s addictiveness\u2014was employed to launch a far more potent product: OxyContin. The drug went on to generate some thirty-five billion dollars in revenue, and to launch a public health crisis in which hundreds of thousands would die. This is the saga of three generations of a single family and the mark they would leave on the world, a tale that moves from the bustling streets of early twentieth-century Brooklyn to the seaside palaces\u00a0of Greenwich, Connecticut, and Cap d\u2019Antibes to the corridors of power in Washington, D.C.\u00a0 Empire of Pain chronicles the multiple investigations of the Sacklers and their company, and the scorched-earth legal tactics that the family has used to evade accountability.\u00a0Empire of Pain is a masterpiece of narrative reporting and writing, exhaustively documented and ferociously compelling. It is a portrait of the excesses of America\u2019s second Gilded Age, a study of impunity among the super elite and a relentless investigation of the naked greed and indifference to human suffering that built one of the world\u2019s great fortunes.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e", "custom_clean": 1, "custom_lists": [{"id": 5, "sort": "Must Read.2021 Time", "value": "Must Read.2021 Time"}], "custom_lists_ids": "5", "custom_read_date": null, "custom_reading_list": 0, "custom_types": "eBook", "flags": 1, "has_cover": 1, "id": 124, "identifier_ids": "408,406,407", "identifiers": [{"book": 124, "id": 407, "name": "ISBN", "path": "https://www.worldcat.org/isbn/9780385545693", "sort": "isbn", "type": "isbn", "val": "9780385545693"}, {"book": 124, "id": 406, "name": "Google Books", "path": "https://books.google.com/books?id=Qb4IEAAAQBAJ", "sort": "google", "type": "google", "val": "Qb4IEAAAQBAJ"}, {"book": 124, "id": 408, "name": "Goodreads", "path": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43868109", "sort": "goodreads", "type": "goodreads", "val": "43868109"}], "isbn": "9780385545693", "language_ids": "1", "languages": [{"avg_rating": 8.429245283018869, "count": 341, "id": 1, "name": "ENG", "sort": "ENG"}], "last_modified": "2023-05-04 17:55:52.136675+00:00", "order_by": "2022-10-05 15:54:07.602947+00:00", "path": "Patrick Radden Keefe/Empire of Pain_ The Secret History (124)", "pubdate": "2021-04-13", "publisher_ids": "82", "publishers": [{"avg_rating": 8.5, "count": 5, "id": 82, "name": "Knopf Publishing Group", "sort": "Knopf Publishing Group"}], "rating": 5, "series": [], "series_ids": null, "size": 5759595, "tag_ids": "51,57,58,60,92,194", "tags": [{"avg_rating": 8.333333333333334, "count": 40, "id": 194, "name": "Time", "sort": 40}, {"avg_rating": 8.222222222222221, "count": 31, "id": 92, "name": "Biography", "sort": 31}, {"avg_rating": 8.363636363636363, "count": 24, "id": 60, "name": "History", "sort": 24}, {"avg_rating": 8.347826086956522, "count": 23, "id": 57, "name": "Politics", "sort": 23}, {"avg_rating": 8.2, "count": 11, "id": 51, "name": "Business", "sort": 11}, {"avg_rating": 8.222222222222221, "count": 11, "id": 58, "name": "Science", "sort": 11}], "timestamp": "2022-10-05 15:54:07.602947+00:00", "title": "Empire of Pain: The Secret History of the Sackler Dynasty"}, {"author_ids": "125", "authors": [{"avg_rating": 8.0, "count": 1, "id": 125, "name": "Viet Thanh Nguyen", "sort": "Nguyen, Viet Thanh"}], "comments": "\u003cdiv\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe sequel to The Sympathizer, which won the 2016 Pulitzer Prize in Fiction and went on to sell over a million copies worldwide, The Committed tells the story of \u201cthe man of two minds\u201d as he comes as a refugee to France and turns his hand to capitalism\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe long-awaited follow-up to the Pulitzer Prize-winning The Sympathizer, which has sold more than one million copies worldwide, The Committed follows the man of two minds as he arrives in Paris in the early 1980s with his blood brother Bon.

Beginning in his hometown of New Orleans, Clint Smith leads the reader on an unforgettable tour of monuments and landmarks--those that are honest about the past and those that are not--that offer an intergenerational story of how slavery has been central in shaping our nation\u0027s collective history, and ourselves. It is the story of the Monticello Plantation in Virginia, the estate where Thomas Jefferson wrote letters espousing the urgent need for liberty while enslaving more than four hundred people. It is the story of the Whitney Plantation, one of the only former plantations devoted to preserving the experience of the enslaved people whose lives and work sustained it. It is the story of Angola, a former plantation-turned-maximum-security prison in Louisiana that is filled with Black men who work across the 18,000-acre land for virtually no pay. And it is the story of Blandford Cemetery, the final resting place of tens of thousands of Confederate soldiers. A deeply researched and transporting exploration of the legacy of slavery and its imprint on centuries of American history, How the Word Is Passed illustrates how some of our country\u0027s most essential stories are hidden in plain view--whether in places we might drive by on our way to work, holidays such as Juneteenth, or entire neighborhoods like downtown Manhattan, where the brutal history of the trade in enslaved men, women, and children has been deeply imprinted. Informed by scholarship and brought to life by the story of people living today, Smith\u0027s debut work of nonfiction is a landmark of reflection and insight that offers a new understanding of the hopeful role that memory and history can play in making sense of our country and how it has come to be.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e", "custom_clean": 1, "custom_lists": [{"id": 5, "sort": "Must Read.2021 Time", "value": "Must Read.2021 Time"}], "custom_lists_ids": "5", "custom_read_date": null, "custom_reading_list": 0, "custom_types": "eBook", "flags": 1, "has_cover": 1, "id": 113, "identifier_ids": "374,376,375,377", "identifiers": [{"book": 113, "id": 377, "name": "ISBN", "path": "https://www.worldcat.org/isbn/9780316492935", "sort": "isbn", "type": "isbn", "val": "9780316492935"}, {"book": 113, "id": 375, "name": "Google Books", "path": "https://books.google.com/books?id=8pEHzgEACAAJ", "sort": "google", "type": "google", "val": "8pEHzgEACAAJ"}, {"book": 113, "id": 376, "name": "Goodreads", "path": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/55643287", "sort": "goodreads", "type": "goodreads", "val": "55643287"}, {"book": 113, "id": 374, "name": "Amazon", "path": "https://amazon.com/dp/0316492930", "sort": "amazon", "type": "amazon", "val": "0316492930"}], "isbn": "9780316492935", "language_ids": "1", "languages": [{"avg_rating": 8.429245283018869, "count": 341, "id": 1, "name": "ENG", "sort": "ENG"}], "last_modified": "2023-05-04 17:55:52.136675+00:00", "order_by": "2022-10-05 15:54:03.677102+00:00", "path": "Clint Smith/How the Word Is Passed_ A Reckoning (113)", "pubdate": "2021-06-01", "publisher_ids": "68", "publishers": [{"avg_rating": 8.5, "count": 4, "id": 68, "name": "Little, Brown and Company", "sort": "Little, Brown and Company"}], "rating": 5, "series": [], "series_ids": null, "size": 568333, "tag_ids": "57,60,194", "tags": [{"avg_rating": 8.333333333333334, "count": 40, "id": 194, "name": "Time", "sort": 40}, {"avg_rating": 8.363636363636363, "count": 24, "id": 60, "name": "History", "sort": 24}, {"avg_rating": 8.347826086956522, "count": 23, "id": 57, "name": "Politics", "sort": 23}], "timestamp": "2022-10-05 15:54:03.677102+00:00", "title": "How the Word Is Passed: A Reckoning With the History of Slavery Across America"}, {"author_ids": "114", "authors": [{"avg_rating": 10.0, "count": 1, "id": 114, "name": "Andrea Elliott", "sort": "Elliott, Andrea"}], "comments": "\u003cdiv\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn Invisible Child, Pulitzer Prize winner Andrea Elliott follows eight dramatic years in the life of Dasani, a girl whose imagination is as soaring as the skyscrapers near her Brooklyn shelter.

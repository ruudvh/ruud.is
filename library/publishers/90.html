When it comes to improbable innovations, a legendary tech VC told Sebastian Mallaby, the future cannot be predicted, it can only be discovered. It is the nature of the venture-capital game that most attempts at discovery fail, but a very few succeed at such a scale that they more than make up for everything else. That extreme ratio of success and failure is the power law that drives the VC business, all of Silicon Valley, the wider tech sector, and, by extension, the world.\u00a0\u00a0 In The Power Law, Sebastian Mallaby has parlayed unprecedented access to the most celebrated venture capitalists of all time\u2014the key figures at Sequoia, Kleiner Perkins, Accel, Benchmark, and Andreessen Horowitz, as well as Chinese partnerships such as Qiming and Capital Today\u2014into a riveting blend of storytelling and analysis that unfurls the history of tech incubation, in the Valley and ultimately worldwide. We learn the unvarnished truth, often for the first time, about some of the most iconic triumphs and infamous disasters in Valley history, from the comedy of errors at the birth of Apple to the avalanche of venture money that fostered hubris at WeWork and Uber.\u00a0 VCs\u2019 relentless search for grand slams brews an obsession with the ideal of the lone entrepreneur-genius, and companies seen as potential \u201cunicorns\u201d are given intoxicating amounts of power, with sometimes disastrous results. On a more systemic level, the need to make outsized bets on unproven talent reinforces bias, with women and minorities still represented at woefully low levels. This does not just have social justice implications: as Mallaby relates, China\u2019s homegrown VC sector, having learned at the Valley\u2019s feet, is exploding and now has more women VC luminaries than America has ever had. Still, Silicon Valley VC remains the top incubator of business innovation anywhere\u2014it is not where ideas come from so much as where they go to become the products and companies that create the future. By taking us so deeply into the VCs\u2019 game, The Power Law helps us think about our own future through their eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e", "custom_clean": 1, "custom_lists": [], "custom_lists_ids": null, "custom_read_date": null, "custom_reading_list": 1, "custom_types": "eBook", "flags": 1, "has_cover": 1, "id": 257, "identifier_ids": "879,880", "identifiers": [{"book": 257, "id": 880, "name": "ISBN", "path": "https://www.worldcat.org/isbn/9780525560005", "sort": "isbn", "type": "isbn", "val": "9780525560005"}, {"book": 257, "id": 879, "name": "Google Books", "path": "https://books.google.com/books?id=a3YsEAAAQBAJ", "sort": "google", "type": "google", "val": "a3YsEAAAQBAJ"}], "isbn": "9780525560005", "language_ids": "1", "languages": [{"avg_rating": 8.429245283018869, "count": 341, "id": 1, "name": "ENG", "sort": "ENG"}], "last_modified": "2023-07-21 14:34:52.350604+00:00", "order_by": "2023-01-27 19:15:58.396903+00:00", "path": "Sebastian Mallaby/The Power Law_ Venture Capital and (257)", "pubdate": "2022-02-01", "publisher_ids": "90", "publishers": [{"avg_rating": 8.8, "count": 20, "id": 90, "name": "Penguin Random House", "sort": "Penguin Random House"}], "rating": null, "series": [], "series_ids": null, "size": 12214615, "tag_ids": "11,191,245,246", "tags": [{"avg_rating": 7.857142857142857, "count": 28, "id": 191, "name": "Computer Science", "sort": 28}, {"avg_rating": 8.2, "count": 13, "id": 11, "name": "Business \u0026 Economics", "sort": 13}, {"avg_rating": 10.0, "count": 2, "id": 245, "name": "Corporate Finance", "sort": 2}, {"avg_rating": 10.0, "count": 2, "id": 246, "name": "Venture Capital", "sort": 2}], "timestamp": "2023-01-27 19:15:58.396903+00:00", "title": "The Power Law: Venture Capital and the Making of the New Future"}, {"author_ids": "167", "authors": [{"avg_rating": 8.666666666666666, "count": 4, "id": 167, "name": "George Orwell", "sort": "Orwell, George"}], "comments": "\u003cdiv\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat was a nice Eton boy like Eric Blair doing in scummy slums instead of being upwardly mobile at Oxford or Cambridge? Living Down and Out in Paris and London , repudiating respectable imperialist society, and reinventing himself as George Orwell. His 1933 debut book (ostensibly a novel, but overwhelmingly autobiographical) was rejected by that elitist publisher T. S. Eliot, perhaps because its close-up portrait of lowlife was too pungent for comfort.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn Paris, Orwell lived in verminous rooms and washed dishes at the overpriced \"Hotel X,\" in a remarkably filthy, 110-degree kitchen. He met \"eccentric people \u2013 people who have fallen into solitary, half-mad grooves of life and given up trying to be normal or decent.\" Though Orwell\u0027s tone is that of an outraged reformer, it\u0027s surprising how entertaining many of his adventures are: gnawing poverty only enlivens the imagination, and the wild characters he met often swindled each other and themselves. The wackiest tale involves a miser who ate cats, wore newspapers for underwear, invested 6,000 francs in cocaine, and hid it in a face-powder tin when the cops raided. They had to free him, because the apparently controlled substance turned out to be face powder instead of cocaine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn London, Orwell studied begging with a crippled expert named Bozo, a great storyteller and philosopher. Orwell devotes a chapter to the fine points of London guttersnipe slang. Years later, he would put his lexical bent to work by inventing Newspeak, and draw on his down-and-out experience to evoke the plight of the Proles in 1984. Though marred by hints of unexamined anti-Semitism, Orwell\u0027s debut remains, as The Nation put it, \"the most lucid portrait of poverty in the English language.\" --Tim Appelo\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e", "custom_clean": 1, "custom_lists": [], "custom_lists_ids": null, "custom_read_date": null, "custom_reading_list": 0, "custom_types": "eBook", "flags": 1, "has_cover": 1, "id": 159, "identifier_ids": "483,484,481,482", "identifiers": [{"book": 159, "id": 482, "name": "ISBN", "path": "https://www.worldcat.org/isbn/9780156262248", "sort": "isbn", "type": "isbn", "val": "9780156262248"}, {"book": 159, "id": 481, "name": "Google Books", "path": "https://books.google.com/books?id=m5vIVN7LjtgC", "sort": "google", "type": "google", "val": "m5vIVN7LjtgC"}, {"book": 159, "id": 484, "name": "Goodreads", "path": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34304872", "sort": "goodreads", "type": "goodreads", "val": "34304872"}, {"book": 159, "id": 483, "name": "Amazon", "path": "https://amazon.com/dp/015626224X", "sort": "amazon", "type": "amazon", "val": "015626224X"}], "isbn": "9780156262248", "language_ids": "1", "languages": [{"avg_rating": 8.429245283018869, "count": 341, "id": 1, "name": "ENG", "sort": "ENG"}], "last_modified": "2023-05-04 17:55:52.136675+00:00", "order_by": "2022-10-06 09:35:53.313990+00:00", "path": "George Orwell/Down and Out in Paris and London (159)", "pubdate": "1933-01-01", "publisher_ids": "90", "publishers": [{"avg_rating": 8.8, "count": 20, "id": 90, "name": "Penguin Random House", "sort": "Penguin Random House"}], "rating": 4, "series": [], "series_ids": null, "size": 690052, "tag_ids": "57,60,90,92,153", "tags": [{"avg_rating": 8.222222222222221, "count": 31, "id": 92, "name": "Biography", "sort": 31}, {"avg_rating": 8.578947368421053, "count": 28, "id": 153, "name": "Classics", "sort": 28}, {"avg_rating": 8.363636363636363, "count": 24, "id": 60, "name": "History", "sort": 24}, {"avg_rating": 8.347826086956522, "count": 23, "id": 57, "name": "Politics", "sort": 23}, {"avg_rating": 7.5, "count": 4, "id": 90, "name": "Travel", "sort": 4}], "timestamp": "2022-10-06 09:35:53.313990+00:00", "title": "Down and Out in Paris and London"}, {"author_ids": "159", "authors": [{"avg_rating": 8.0, "count": 1, "id": 159, "name": "Sunjeev Sahota", "sort": "Sahota, Sunjeev"}], "comments": "\u003cdiv\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA transfixing novel about two unforgettable characters seeking to free themselves--one from the expectations of women in early 20th century Punjab, and the other from the weight of life in the contemporary Indian diaspora\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMehar, a young bride in rural 1929 Punjab, is trying to discover the identity of her new husband.

From beneath her veil, she studies the sounds of the men\u0027s voices, the calluses on their fingers as she serves them tea. Soon she glimpses something that seems to confirm which of the brothers is her husband, and a series of events is set in motion that will put more than one life at risk.

Next he directed four consecutive hit plays, won back-to-back Tonys, ushered in a new era of Hollywood moviemaking with Who\u0027s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?, and followed it with The Graduate, which won him an Oscar and became the third-highest-grossing movie ever.

Out of their trials and their repeated collisions against the hard realities of an America divided into Haves and Have-Nots evolves a drama that is intensely human yet majestic in its scale and moral vision, elemental yet plainspoken, tragic but ultimately stirring in its human dignity. A portrait of the conflict between the powerful and the powerless, of one man\u2019s fierce reaction to injustice, and of one woman\u2019s stoical strength, the novel captures the horrors of the Great Depression and probes into the very nature of equality and justice in America. At once a naturalistic epic, captivity narrative, road novel, and transcendental gospel, Steinbeck\u2019s powerful landmark novel is perhaps the most American of American Classics. \u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e", "custom_clean": 1, "custom_lists": [{"id": 14, "sort": "Must Read.25 Must Read", "value": "Must Read.25 Must Read"}], "custom_lists_ids": "14", "custom_read_date": null, "custom_reading_list": 0, "custom_types": "eBook", "flags": 1, "has_cover": 1, "id": 446, "identifier_ids": "1239,1238,1240", "identifiers": [{"book": 446, "id": 1240, "name": "ISBN", "path": "https://www.worldcat.org/isbn/9780143039433", "sort": "isbn", "type": "isbn", "val": "9780143039433"}, {"book": 446, "id": 1238, "name": "Google Books", "path": "https://books.google.com/books?id=bhJgd3hGdxQC", "sort": "google", "type": "google", "val": "bhJgd3hGdxQC"}, {"book": 446, "id": 1239, "name": "Amazon", "path": "https://amazon.com/dp/0143039431", "sort": "amazon", "type": "amazon", "val": "0143039431"}], "isbn": "9780143039433", "language_ids": "1", "languages": [{"avg_rating": 8.429245283018869, "count": 341, "id": 1, "name": "ENG", "sort": "ENG"}], "last_modified": "2023-07-21 14:32:47.527874+00:00", "order_by": "2020-03-03 23:00:00+00:00", "path": "John Steinbeck/The Grapes of Wrath (446)", "pubdate": "2006-03-27", "publisher_ids": "90", "publishers": [{"avg_rating": 8.8, "count": 20, "id": 90, "name": "Penguin Random House", "sort": "Penguin Random House"}], "rating": 5, "series": [], "series_ids": null, "size": 1950305, "tag_ids": "4,148,152,153,349,400,401,402,403,404,405,406,407", "tags": [{"avg_rating": 9.25, "count": 97, "id": 4, "name": "Fiction", "sort": 97}, {"avg_rating": 8.461538461538462, "count": 47, "id": 349, "name": "General", "sort": 47}, {"avg_rating": 8.578947368421053, "count": 28, "id": 153, "name": "Classics", "sort": 28}, {"avg_rating": 9.0, "count": 11, "id": 152, "name": "Literary", "sort": 11}, {"avg_rating": 9.333333333333334, "count": 5, "id": 148, "name": "Historical", "sort": 5}, {"avg_rating": 10.0, "count": 1, "id": 400, "name": "Domestic fiction", "sort": 1}, {"avg_rating": 10.0, "count": 1, "id": 401, "name": "Political fiction", "sort": 1}, {"avg_rating": 10.0, "count": 1, "id": 402, "name": "California", "sort": 1}, {"avg_rating": 10.0, "count": 1, "id": 403, "name": "Rural families", "sort": 1}, {"avg_rating": 10.0, "count": 1, "id": 404, "name": "Migrant agricultural laborers", "sort": 1}, {"avg_rating": 10.0, "count": 1, "id": 405, "name": "Depressions", "sort": 1}, {"avg_rating": 10.0, "count": 1, "id": 406, "name": "Labor camps", "sort": 1}, {"avg_rating": 10.0, "count": 1, "id": 407, "name": "Oklahoma", "sort": 1}], "timestamp": "2020-03-03 23:00:00+00:00", "title": "The Grapes of Wrath"}, {"author_ids": "459", "authors": [{"avg_rating": 8.0, "count": 1, "id": 459, "name": "William Golding", "sort": "Golding, William"}], "comments": "\u003cdiv\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the dawn of the next world war, a plane crashes on an uncharted island, stranding a group of schoolboys.

After eighteen years as a political prisoner in the Bastille the aging Dr Manette is finally released and reunited with his daughter in England. There, two very different men, Charles Darnay, an exiled French aristocrat, and Sydney Carton, a disreputable but brilliant English lawyer, become enmeshed through their love for Lucie Manette. From the tranquil lanes of London, they are all drawn against their will to the vengeful, bloodstained streets of Paris at the height of the Reign of Terror and soon fall under the lethal shadow of La Guillotine. This edition uses the text as it appeared in its first serial publication in 1859 to convey the full scope of Dickens\u0027s vision, and includes the original illustrations by H.K. Browne (\u0027Phiz\u0027). Richard Maxwell\u0027s introduction discusses the intricate interweaving of epic drama with personal tragedy. \u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e", "custom_clean": 1, "custom_lists": [{"id": 14, "sort": "Must Read.25 Must Read", "value": "Must Read.25 Must Read"}], "custom_lists_ids": "14", "custom_read_date": null, "custom_reading_list": 0, "custom_types": "eBook", "flags": 1, "has_cover": 1, "id": 456, "identifier_ids": "1218,1216,1217", "identifiers": [{"book": 456, "id": 1217, "name": "ISBN", "path": "https://www.worldcat.org/isbn/9780141933795", "sort": "isbn", "type": "isbn", "val": "9780141933795"}, {"book": 456, "id": 1216, "name": "Google Books", "path": "https://books.google.com/books?id=YK3Yg_ZLWMMC", "sort": "google", "type": "google", "val": "YK3Yg_ZLWMMC"}, {"book": 456, "id": 1218, "name": "Amazon", "path": "https://amazon.com/dp/0141439602", "sort": "amazon", "type": "amazon", "val": "0141439602"}], "isbn": "9780141933795", "language_ids": "1", "languages": [{"avg_rating": 8.429245283018869, "count": 341, "id": 1, "name": "ENG", "sort": "ENG"}], "last_modified": "2023-07-21 14:33:19.688092+00:00", "order_by": "2020-03-03 23:00:00+00:00", "path": "Charles Dickens/A Tale of Two Cities (456)", "pubdate": "2003-05-26", "publisher_ids": "90", "publishers": [{"avg_rating": 8.8, "count": 20, "id": 90, "name": "Penguin Random House", "sort": "Penguin Random House"}], "rating": 4, "series": [], "series_ids": null, "size": 1034267, "tag_ids": "4,153", "tags": [{"avg_rating": 9.25, "count": 97, "id": 4, "name": "Fiction", "sort": 97}, {"avg_rating": 8.578947368421053, "count": 28, "id": 153, "name": "Classics", "sort": 28}], "timestamp": "2020-03-03 23:00:00+00:00", "title": "A Tale of Two Cities"}])' x-show="activeTab === 'tabCards'"

When it comes to improbable innovations, a legendary tech VC told Sebastian Mallaby, the future cannot be predicted, it can only be discovered. It is the nature of the venture-capital game that most attempts at discovery fail, but a very few succeed at such a scale that they more than make up for everything else. That extreme ratio of success and failure is the power law that drives the VC business, all of Silicon Valley, the wider tech sector, and, by extension, the world.\u00a0\u00a0 In The Power Law, Sebastian Mallaby has parlayed unprecedented access to the most celebrated venture capitalists of all time\u2014the key figures at Sequoia, Kleiner Perkins, Accel, Benchmark, and Andreessen Horowitz, as well as Chinese partnerships such as Qiming and Capital Today\u2014into a riveting blend of storytelling and analysis that unfurls the history of tech incubation, in the Valley and ultimately worldwide. We learn the unvarnished truth, often for the first time, about some of the most iconic triumphs and infamous disasters in Valley history, from the comedy of errors at the birth of Apple to the avalanche of venture money that fostered hubris at WeWork and Uber.\u00a0 VCs\u2019 relentless search for grand slams brews an obsession with the ideal of the lone entrepreneur-genius, and companies seen as potential \u201cunicorns\u201d are given intoxicating amounts of power, with sometimes disastrous results. On a more systemic level, the need to make outsized bets on unproven talent reinforces bias, with women and minorities still represented at woefully low levels. This does not just have social justice implications: as Mallaby relates, China\u2019s homegrown VC sector, having learned at the Valley\u2019s feet, is exploding and now has more women VC luminaries than America has ever had. Still, Silicon Valley VC remains the top incubator of business innovation anywhere\u2014it is not where ideas come from so much as where they go to become the products and companies that create the future. By taking us so deeply into the VCs\u2019 game, The Power Law helps us think about our own future through their eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e", "custom_clean": 1, "custom_lists": [], "custom_lists_ids": null, "custom_read_date": null, "custom_reading_list": 1, "custom_types": "eBook", "flags": 1, "has_cover": 1, "id": 257, "identifier_ids": "879,880", "identifiers": [{"book": 257, "id": 880, "name": "ISBN", "path": "https://www.worldcat.org/isbn/9780525560005", "sort": "isbn", "type": "isbn", "val": "9780525560005"}, {"book": 257, "id": 879, "name": "Google Books", "path": "https://books.google.com/books?id=a3YsEAAAQBAJ", "sort": "google", "type": "google", "val": "a3YsEAAAQBAJ"}], "isbn": "9780525560005", "language_ids": "1", "languages": [{"avg_rating": 8.429245283018869, "count": 341, "id": 1, "name": "ENG", "sort": "ENG"}], "last_modified": "2023-07-21 14:34:52.350604+00:00", "order_by": "2023-01-27 19:15:58.396903+00:00", "path": "Sebastian Mallaby/The Power Law_ Venture Capital and (257)", "pubdate": "2022-02-01", "publisher_ids": "90", "publishers": [{"avg_rating": 8.8, "count": 20, "id": 90, "name": "Penguin Random House", "sort": "Penguin Random House"}], "rating": null, "series": [], "series_ids": null, "size": 12214615, "tag_ids": "11,191,245,246", "tags": [{"avg_rating": 7.857142857142857, "count": 28, "id": 191, "name": "Computer Science", "sort": 28}, {"avg_rating": 8.2, "count": 13, "id": 11, "name": "Business \u0026 Economics", "sort": 13}, {"avg_rating": 10.0, "count": 2, "id": 245, "name": "Corporate Finance", "sort": 2}, {"avg_rating": 10.0, "count": 2, "id": 246, "name": "Venture Capital", "sort": 2}], "timestamp": "2023-01-27 19:15:58.396903+00:00", "title": "The Power Law: Venture Capital and the Making of the New Future"}, {"author_ids": "167", "authors": [{"avg_rating": 8.666666666666666, "count": 4, "id": 167, "name": "George Orwell", "sort": "Orwell, George"}], "comments": "\u003cdiv\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat was a nice Eton boy like Eric Blair doing in scummy slums instead of being upwardly mobile at Oxford or Cambridge? Living Down and Out in Paris and London , repudiating respectable imperialist society, and reinventing himself as George Orwell. His 1933 debut book (ostensibly a novel, but overwhelmingly autobiographical) was rejected by that elitist publisher T. S. Eliot, perhaps because its close-up portrait of lowlife was too pungent for comfort.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn Paris, Orwell lived in verminous rooms and washed dishes at the overpriced \"Hotel X,\" in a remarkably filthy, 110-degree kitchen. He met \"eccentric people \u2013 people who have fallen into solitary, half-mad grooves of life and given up trying to be normal or decent.\" Though Orwell\u0027s tone is that of an outraged reformer, it\u0027s surprising how entertaining many of his adventures are: gnawing poverty only enlivens the imagination, and the wild characters he met often swindled each other and themselves. The wackiest tale involves a miser who ate cats, wore newspapers for underwear, invested 6,000 francs in cocaine, and hid it in a face-powder tin when the cops raided. They had to free him, because the apparently controlled substance turned out to be face powder instead of cocaine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn London, Orwell studied begging with a crippled expert named Bozo, a great storyteller and philosopher. Orwell devotes a chapter to the fine points of London guttersnipe slang. Years later, he would put his lexical bent to work by inventing Newspeak, and draw on his down-and-out experience to evoke the plight of the Proles in 1984. Though marred by hints of unexamined anti-Semitism, Orwell\u0027s debut remains, as The Nation put it, \"the most lucid portrait of poverty in the English language.\" --Tim Appelo\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e", "custom_clean": 1, "custom_lists": [], "custom_lists_ids": null, "custom_read_date": null, "custom_reading_list": 0, "custom_types": "eBook", "flags": 1, "has_cover": 1, "id": 159, "identifier_ids": "483,484,481,482", "identifiers": [{"book": 159, "id": 482, "name": "ISBN", "path": "https://www.worldcat.org/isbn/9780156262248", "sort": "isbn", "type": "isbn", "val": "9780156262248"}, {"book": 159, "id": 481, "name": "Google Books", "path": "https://books.google.com/books?id=m5vIVN7LjtgC", "sort": "google", "type": "google", "val": "m5vIVN7LjtgC"}, {"book": 159, "id": 484, "name": "Goodreads", "path": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34304872", "sort": "goodreads", "type": "goodreads", "val": "34304872"}, {"book": 159, "id": 483, "name": "Amazon", "path": "https://amazon.com/dp/015626224X", "sort": "amazon", "type": "amazon", "val": "015626224X"}], "isbn": "9780156262248", "language_ids": "1", "languages": [{"avg_rating": 8.429245283018869, "count": 341, "id": 1, "name": "ENG", "sort": "ENG"}], "last_modified": "2023-05-04 17:55:52.136675+00:00", "order_by": "2022-10-06 09:35:53.313990+00:00", "path": "George Orwell/Down and Out in Paris and London (159)", "pubdate": "1933-01-01", "publisher_ids": "90", "publishers": [{"avg_rating": 8.8, "count": 20, "id": 90, "name": "Penguin Random House", "sort": "Penguin Random House"}], "rating": 4, "series": [], "series_ids": null, "size": 690052, "tag_ids": "57,60,90,92,153", "tags": [{"avg_rating": 8.222222222222221, "count": 31, "id": 92, "name": "Biography", "sort": 31}, {"avg_rating": 8.578947368421053, "count": 28, "id": 153, "name": "Classics", "sort": 28}, {"avg_rating": 8.363636363636363, "count": 24, "id": 60, "name": "History", "sort": 24}, {"avg_rating": 8.347826086956522, "count": 23, "id": 57, "name": "Politics", "sort": 23}, {"avg_rating": 7.5, "count": 4, "id": 90, "name": "Travel", "sort": 4}], "timestamp": "2022-10-06 09:35:53.313990+00:00", "title": "Down and Out in Paris and London"}, {"author_ids": "159", "authors": [{"avg_rating": 8.0, "count": 1, "id": 159, "name": "Sunjeev Sahota", "sort": "Sahota, Sunjeev"}], "comments": "\u003cdiv\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA transfixing novel about two unforgettable characters seeking to free themselves--one from the expectations of women in early 20th century Punjab, and the other from the weight of life in the contemporary Indian diaspora\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMehar, a young bride in rural 1929 Punjab, is trying to discover the identity of her new husband.

Next he directed four consecutive hit plays, won back-to-back Tonys, ushered in a new era of Hollywood moviemaking with Who\u0027s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?, and followed it with The Graduate, which won him an Oscar and became the third-highest-grossing movie ever. At thirty-five, he lived in a three-story Central Park West penthouse, drove a Rolls-Royce, collected Arabian horses, and counted Jacqueline Kennedy, Elizabeth Taylor, Leonard Bernstein, and Richard Avedon as friends.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhere he arrived is even more astonishing given where he had begun: born Igor Peschkowsky to a Jewish couple in Berlin in 1931, he was sent along with his younger brother to America on a ship in 1939. The young immigrant boy caught very few breaks. He was bullied and ostracized--an allergic reaction had rendered him permanently hairless--and his father died when he was just twelve, leaving his mother alone and overwhelmed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe gulf between these two sets of facts explains a great deal about Nichols\u0027s transformation from lonely outsider to the center of more than one cultural universe--the acute powers of observation that first made him famous; the nourishment he drew from his creative partnerships, most enduringly with May; his unquenchable drive; his hunger for security and status; and the depressions and self-medications that brought him to terrible lows. It would take decades for him to come to grips with his demons. In an incomparable portrait that follows Nichols from Berlin to New York to Chicago to Hollywood, Mark Harris explores, with brilliantly vivid detail and insight, the life, work, struggle, and passion of an artist and man in constant motion. Among the 250 people Harris interviewed: Elaine May, Meryl Streep, Stephen Sondheim, Robert Redford, Glenn Close, Tom Hanks, Candice Bergen, Emma Thompson, Annette Bening, Natalie Portman, Julia Roberts, Lorne Michaels, and Gloria Steinem.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMark Harris gives an intimate and evenhanded accounting of success and failure alike; the portrait is not always flattering, but its ultimate impact is to present the full story of one of the most richly interesting, complicated, and consequential figures the worlds of theater and motion pictures have ever seen.

The contents of Ashley\u2019s sack\u2014a tattered dress, handfuls of pecans, a braid of hair, \u201cmy Love always\u201d\u2014are eloquent evidence of the lives these women lived.

Out of their trials and their repeated collisions against the hard realities of an America divided into Haves and Have-Nots evolves a drama that is intensely human yet majestic in its scale and moral vision, elemental yet plainspoken, tragic but ultimately stirring in its human dignity. A portrait of the conflict between the powerful and the powerless, of one man\u2019s fierce reaction to injustice, and of one woman\u2019s stoical strength, the novel captures the horrors of the Great Depression and probes into the very nature of equality and justice in America. At once a naturalistic epic, captivity narrative, road novel, and transcendental gospel, Steinbeck\u2019s powerful landmark novel is perhaps the most American of American Classics. \u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e", "custom_clean": 1, "custom_lists": [{"id": 14, "sort": "Must Read.25 Must Read", "value": "Must Read.25 Must Read"}], "custom_lists_ids": "14", "custom_read_date": null, "custom_reading_list": 0, "custom_types": "eBook", "flags": 1, "has_cover": 1, "id": 446, "identifier_ids": "1239,1238,1240", "identifiers": [{"book": 446, "id": 1240, "name": "ISBN", "path": "https://www.worldcat.org/isbn/9780143039433", "sort": "isbn", "type": "isbn", "val": "9780143039433"}, {"book": 446, "id": 1238, "name": "Google Books", "path": "https://books.google.com/books?id=bhJgd3hGdxQC", "sort": "google", "type": "google", "val": "bhJgd3hGdxQC"}, {"book": 446, "id": 1239, "name": "Amazon", "path": "https://amazon.com/dp/0143039431", "sort": "amazon", "type": "amazon", "val": "0143039431"}], "isbn": "9780143039433", "language_ids": "1", "languages": [{"avg_rating": 8.429245283018869, "count": 341, "id": 1, "name": "ENG", "sort": "ENG"}], "last_modified": "2023-07-21 14:32:47.527874+00:00", "order_by": "2020-03-03 23:00:00+00:00", "path": "John Steinbeck/The Grapes of Wrath (446)", "pubdate": "2006-03-27", "publisher_ids": "90", "publishers": [{"avg_rating": 8.8, "count": 20, "id": 90, "name": "Penguin Random House", "sort": "Penguin Random House"}], "rating": 5, "series": [], "series_ids": null, "size": 1950305, "tag_ids": "4,148,152,153,349,400,401,402,403,404,405,406,407", "tags": [{"avg_rating": 9.25, "count": 97, "id": 4, "name": "Fiction", "sort": 97}, {"avg_rating": 8.461538461538462, "count": 47, "id": 349, "name": "General", "sort": 47}, {"avg_rating": 8.578947368421053, "count": 28, "id": 153, "name": "Classics", "sort": 28}, {"avg_rating": 9.0, "count": 11, "id": 152, "name": "Literary", "sort": 11}, {"avg_rating": 9.333333333333334, "count": 5, "id": 148, "name": "Historical", "sort": 5}, {"avg_rating": 10.0, "count": 1, "id": 400, "name": "Domestic fiction", "sort": 1}, {"avg_rating": 10.0, "count": 1, "id": 401, "name": "Political fiction", "sort": 1}, {"avg_rating": 10.0, "count": 1, "id": 402, "name": "California", "sort": 1}, {"avg_rating": 10.0, "count": 1, "id": 403, "name": "Rural families", "sort": 1}, {"avg_rating": 10.0, "count": 1, "id": 404, "name": "Migrant agricultural laborers", "sort": 1}, {"avg_rating": 10.0, "count": 1, "id": 405, "name": "Depressions", "sort": 1}, {"avg_rating": 10.0, "count": 1, "id": 406, "name": "Labor camps", "sort": 1}, {"avg_rating": 10.0, "count": 1, "id": 407, "name": "Oklahoma", "sort": 1}], "timestamp": "2020-03-03 23:00:00+00:00", "title": "The Grapes of Wrath"}, {"author_ids": "459", "authors": [{"avg_rating": 8.0, "count": 1, "id": 459, "name": "William Golding", "sort": "Golding, William"}], "comments": "\u003cdiv\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the dawn of the next world war, a plane crashes on an uncharted island, stranding a group of schoolboys.

After eighteen years as a political prisoner in the Bastille the aging Dr Manette is finally released and reunited with his daughter in England. There, two very different men, Charles Darnay, an exiled French aristocrat, and Sydney Carton, a disreputable but brilliant English lawyer, become enmeshed through their love for Lucie Manette. From the tranquil lanes of London, they are all drawn against their will to the vengeful, bloodstained streets of Paris at the height of the Reign of Terror and soon fall under the lethal shadow of La Guillotine. This edition uses the text as it appeared in its first serial publication in 1859 to convey the full scope of Dickens\u0027s vision, and includes the original illustrations by H.K. Browne (\u0027Phiz\u0027). Richard Maxwell\u0027s introduction discusses the intricate interweaving of epic drama with personal tragedy. \u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e", "custom_clean": 1, "custom_lists": [{"id": 14, "sort": "Must Read.25 Must Read", "value": "Must Read.25 Must Read"}], "custom_lists_ids": "14", "custom_read_date": null, "custom_reading_list": 0, "custom_types": "eBook", "flags": 1, "has_cover": 1, "id": 456, "identifier_ids": "1218,1216,1217", "identifiers": [{"book": 456, "id": 1217, "name": "ISBN", "path": "https://www.worldcat.org/isbn/9780141933795", "sort": "isbn", "type": "isbn", "val": "9780141933795"}, {"book": 456, "id": 1216, "name": "Google Books", "path": "https://books.google.com/books?id=YK3Yg_ZLWMMC", "sort": "google", "type": "google", "val": "YK3Yg_ZLWMMC"}, {"book": 456, "id": 1218, "name": "Amazon", "path": "https://amazon.com/dp/0141439602", "sort": "amazon", "type": "amazon", "val": "0141439602"}], "isbn": "9780141933795", "language_ids": "1", "languages": [{"avg_rating": 8.429245283018869, "count": 341, "id": 1, "name": "ENG", "sort": "ENG"}], "last_modified": "2023-07-21 14:33:19.688092+00:00", "order_by": "2020-03-03 23:00:00+00:00", "path": "Charles Dickens/A Tale of Two Cities (456)", "pubdate": "2003-05-26", "publisher_ids": "90", "publishers": [{"avg_rating": 8.8, "count": 20, "id": 90, "name": "Penguin Random House", "sort": "Penguin Random House"}], "rating": 4, "series": [], "series_ids": null, "size": 1034267, "tag_ids": "4,153", "tags": [{"avg_rating": 9.25, "count": 97, "id": 4, "name": "Fiction", "sort": 97}, {"avg_rating": 8.578947368421053, "count": 28, "id": 153, "name": "Classics", "sort": 28}], "timestamp": "2020-03-03 23:00:00+00:00", "title": "A Tale of Two Cities"}])'></div>

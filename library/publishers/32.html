For fans of Tina Fey, David Sedaris and anyone who\u0027s ever felt like a misfit, an outrageously funny and disturbing memoir from Jenny Lawson, aka The Bloggess. \u0027When I tell people that my father is kind of a total lunatic, they laugh and nod knowingly. they assure me that theirs is too, and that he\u0027s just a \"typical father\". And they\u0027re probably right, if the typical father runs a full-time taxidermy business out of the house, and shows up at the local bar with a miniature donkey and a teddy Roosevelt impersonator, and thinks other people are weird for making such a big deal out of it. If the typical father says things like \"Happy birthday! Here\u0027s a bathtub of raccoons!\" or \"We\u0027ll have to take your car. Mine has too much blood in it,\" then yeah, he\u0027s totally normal.\u0027 When Jenny Lawson was little, all she ever wanted was to fit in. that dream was cut short by her fantastically unbalanced father and a childhood of wearing winter shoes made out of used bread sacks. It did, however, open up an opportunity for Lawson to find the humour in the strange shame-spiral that is her life, and we are all the better for it. Lawson\u0027s long-suffering husband and sweet daughter help her uncover the surprising discovery that the most terribly human moments - the ones we want to pretend never happened - are the very same moments that make us the people we are today. Like laughing at a funeral, LEt\u0027S PREtEND tHIS NEVER HAPPENED is both irreverent and impossible to hold back once you get started. \u0027the Bloggess writes stuff that actually is laugh-out-loud, but you know that really you shouldn\u0027t be laughing and probably you\u0027ll go to hell for laughing, so maybe you shouldn\u0027t read it.\u0027 Neil Gaiman \u0027Even when I was funny, I wasn\u0027t this funny.\u0027 Augusten Burroughs, author of RUNNING WItH SCISSORS\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e", "custom_clean": 1, "custom_lists": [], "custom_lists_ids": null, "custom_read_date": "2021-10-06", "custom_reading_list": 0, "custom_types": "eBook", "flags": 1, "has_cover": 1, "id": 98, "identifier_ids": "244,243,241,242", "identifiers": [{"book": 98, "id": 242, "name": "ISBN", "path": "https://www.worldcat.org/isbn/9781743096444", "sort": "isbn", "type": "isbn", "val": "9781743096444"}, {"book": 98, "id": 241, "name": "Google Books", "path": "https://books.google.com/books?id=9XJnMt0sXp4C", "sort": "google", "type": "google", "val": "9XJnMt0sXp4C"}, {"book": 98, "id": 243, "name": "Goodreads", "path": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35284712", "sort": "goodreads", "type": "goodreads", "val": "35284712"}, {"book": 98, "id": 244, "name": "Amazon", "path": "https://amazon.com/dp/0425261018", "sort": "amazon", "type": "amazon", "val": "0425261018"}], "isbn": "9781743096444", "language_ids": "1", "languages": [{"avg_rating": 8.429245283018869, "count": 341, "id": 1, "name": "ENG", "sort": "ENG"}], "last_modified": "2022-10-06 17:19:38.709950+00:00", "order_by": "2022-10-05 15:04:19.746379+00:00", "path": "Jenny Lawson/Let\u0027s Pretend This Never Happened (98)", "pubdate": "2012-04-17", "publisher_ids": "32", "publishers": [{"avg_rating": 9.0, "count": 29, "id": 32, "name": "HarperCollins", "sort": "HarperCollins"}], "rating": 4, "series": [], "series_ids": null, "size": 4201264, "tag_ids": "92", "tags": [{"avg_rating": 8.222222222222221, "count": 31, "id": 92, "name": "Biography", "sort": 31}], "timestamp": "2022-10-05 15:04:19.746379+00:00", "title": "Let\u0027s Pretend This Never Happened"}, {"author_ids": "92", "authors": [{"avg_rating": 8.0, "count": 5, "id": 92, "name": "J.R.R.

It Doesn\u0027t Have to Be Crazy at Work is a direct successor to Rework, the instant bestseller that showed readers a new path to working effectively. Now Fried and Heinemeier Hansson have returned with a new strategy for the ideal company culture - what they call the calm company . It is a direct attack on the chaos, anxiety and stress that plagues millions of workplaces and billions of people working their day jobs. Working to breaking point with long hours, excessive workload, and a lack of sleep have become a badge of honour for many people these days, when it should be a mark of stupidity. This isn\u0027t just a problem for large organisations; individuals, contractors and solopreneurs are burning themselves out in the very same way. As the authors reveal, the answer isn\u0027t more hours. Rather, it\u0027s less waste and fewer things that induce distraction, always-on anxiety and stress. It is time to stop celebrating crazy and start celebrating calm. Fried and Hansson have the proof to back up their argument. Calm has been the cornerstone of their company\u0027s culture since Basecamp began twenty years ago. Destined to become the management guide for the next generation, It Doesn\u0027t Have to Be Crazy at Work is a practical and inspiring distillation of their insights and experiences. It isn\u0027t a book telling you what to do. It\u0027s a book showing you what they\u0027ve done-and how any manager or executive no matter the industry or size of the company, can do it too.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e", "custom_clean": 1, "custom_lists": [], "custom_lists_ids": null, "custom_read_date": null, "custom_reading_list": 0, "custom_types": "eBook", "flags": 1, "has_cover": 1, "id": 57, "identifier_ids": "594,596,592,593,595", "identifiers": [{"book": 57, "id": 595, "name": "ISBN", "path": "https://www.worldcat.org/isbn/9780062874795", "sort": "isbn", "type": "isbn", "val": "9780062874795"}, {"book": 57, "id": 593, "name": "Google Books", "path": "https://books.google.com/books?id=aOlMDwAAQBAJ", "sort": "google", "type": "google", "val": "aOlMDwAAQBAJ"}, {"book": 57, "id": 592, "name": "Goodreads", "path": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39674332", "sort": "goodreads", "type": "goodreads", "val": "39674332"}, {"book": 57, "id": 596, "name": "Barnes \u0026 Noble", "path": "https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/it-doesnt-have-to-be-crazy-at-work-jason-fried/1128018111", "sort": "barnesnoble", "type": "barnesnoble", "val": "w/it-doesnt-have-to-be-crazy-at-work-jason-fried/1128018111"}, {"book": 57, "id": 594, "name": "Amazon", "path": "https://amazon.com/dp/0062874780", "sort": "amazon", "type": "amazon", "val": "0062874780"}], "isbn": "9780062874795", "language_ids": "1", "languages": [{"avg_rating": 8.429245283018869, "count": 341, "id": 1, "name": "ENG", "sort": "ENG"}], "last_modified": "2022-10-06 17:19:38.709950+00:00", "order_by": "2022-10-04 13:46:52.016000+00:00", "path": "Jason Fried/It Doesn\u0027t Have to Be Crazy at Work (57)", "pubdate": "2018-10-02", "publisher_ids": "32", "publishers": [{"avg_rating": 9.0, "count": 29, "id": 32, "name": "HarperCollins", "sort": "HarperCollins"}], "rating": 4, "series": [], "series_ids": null, "size": 2765822, "tag_ids": "43,51", "tags": [{"avg_rating": 8.0, "count": 27, "id": 43, "name": "Self Help", "sort": 27}, {"avg_rating": 8.2, "count": 11, "id": 51, "name": "Business", "sort": 11}], "timestamp": "2022-10-04 13:46:52.016000+00:00", "title": "It Doesn\u0027t Have to Be Crazy at Work"}, {"author_ids": "87", "authors": [{"avg_rating": 8.0, "count": 1, "id": 87, "name": "Simon T.

For fans of Tina Fey, David Sedaris and anyone who\u0027s ever felt like a misfit, an outrageously funny and disturbing memoir from Jenny Lawson, aka The Bloggess. \u0027When I tell people that my father is kind of a total lunatic, they laugh and nod knowingly. they assure me that theirs is too, and that he\u0027s just a \"typical father\". And they\u0027re probably right, if the typical father runs a full-time taxidermy business out of the house, and shows up at the local bar with a miniature donkey and a teddy Roosevelt impersonator, and thinks other people are weird for making such a big deal out of it. If the typical father says things like \"Happy birthday! Here\u0027s a bathtub of raccoons!\" or \"We\u0027ll have to take your car. Mine has too much blood in it,\" then yeah, he\u0027s totally normal.\u0027 When Jenny Lawson was little, all she ever wanted was to fit in. that dream was cut short by her fantastically unbalanced father and a childhood of wearing winter shoes made out of used bread sacks. It did, however, open up an opportunity for Lawson to find the humour in the strange shame-spiral that is her life, and we are all the better for it. Lawson\u0027s long-suffering husband and sweet daughter help her uncover the surprising discovery that the most terribly human moments - the ones we want to pretend never happened - are the very same moments that make us the people we are today. Like laughing at a funeral, LEt\u0027S PREtEND tHIS NEVER HAPPENED is both irreverent and impossible to hold back once you get started. \u0027the Bloggess writes stuff that actually is laugh-out-loud, but you know that really you shouldn\u0027t be laughing and probably you\u0027ll go to hell for laughing, so maybe you shouldn\u0027t read it.\u0027 Neil Gaiman \u0027Even when I was funny, I wasn\u0027t this funny.\u0027 Augusten Burroughs, author of RUNNING WItH SCISSORS\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e", "custom_clean": 1, "custom_lists": [], "custom_lists_ids": null, "custom_read_date": "2021-10-06", "custom_reading_list": 0, "custom_types": "eBook", "flags": 1, "has_cover": 1, "id": 98, "identifier_ids": "244,243,241,242", "identifiers": [{"book": 98, "id": 242, "name": "ISBN", "path": "https://www.worldcat.org/isbn/9781743096444", "sort": "isbn", "type": "isbn", "val": "9781743096444"}, {"book": 98, "id": 241, "name": "Google Books", "path": "https://books.google.com/books?id=9XJnMt0sXp4C", "sort": "google", "type": "google", "val": "9XJnMt0sXp4C"}, {"book": 98, "id": 243, "name": "Goodreads", "path": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35284712", "sort": "goodreads", "type": "goodreads", "val": "35284712"}, {"book": 98, "id": 244, "name": "Amazon", "path": "https://amazon.com/dp/0425261018", "sort": "amazon", "type": "amazon", "val": "0425261018"}], "isbn": "9781743096444", "language_ids": "1", "languages": [{"avg_rating": 8.429245283018869, "count": 341, "id": 1, "name": "ENG", "sort": "ENG"}], "last_modified": "2022-10-06 17:19:38.709950+00:00", "order_by": "2022-10-05 15:04:19.746379+00:00", "path": "Jenny Lawson/Let\u0027s Pretend This Never Happened (98)", "pubdate": "2012-04-17", "publisher_ids": "32", "publishers": [{"avg_rating": 9.0, "count": 29, "id": 32, "name": "HarperCollins", "sort": "HarperCollins"}], "rating": 4, "series": [], "series_ids": null, "size": 4201264, "tag_ids": "92", "tags": [{"avg_rating": 8.222222222222221, "count": 31, "id": 92, "name": "Biography", "sort": 31}], "timestamp": "2022-10-05 15:04:19.746379+00:00", "title": "Let\u0027s Pretend This Never Happened"}, {"author_ids": "92", "authors": [{"avg_rating": 8.0, "count": 5, "id": 92, "name": "J.R.R.

It Doesn\u0027t Have to Be Crazy at Work is a direct successor to Rework, the instant bestseller that showed readers a new path to working effectively. Now Fried and Heinemeier Hansson have returned with a new strategy for the ideal company culture - what they call the calm company . It is a direct attack on the chaos, anxiety and stress that plagues millions of workplaces and billions of people working their day jobs. Working to breaking point with long hours, excessive workload, and a lack of sleep have become a badge of honour for many people these days, when it should be a mark of stupidity. This isn\u0027t just a problem for large organisations; individuals, contractors and solopreneurs are burning themselves out in the very same way. As the authors reveal, the answer isn\u0027t more hours. Rather, it\u0027s less waste and fewer things that induce distraction, always-on anxiety and stress. It is time to stop celebrating crazy and start celebrating calm. Fried and Hansson have the proof to back up their argument. Calm has been the cornerstone of their company\u0027s culture since Basecamp began twenty years ago. Destined to become the management guide for the next generation, It Doesn\u0027t Have to Be Crazy at Work is a practical and inspiring distillation of their insights and experiences. It isn\u0027t a book telling you what to do.

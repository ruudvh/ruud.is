These important advances for security and privacy create new content moderation challenges for online services, because services can no longer directly access plaintext content. While ongoing public policy debates about E2EE and content moderation in the United States and European Union emphasize child sexual abuse material and misinformation in messaging and storage, we identify and synthesize a wealth of scholarship that goes far beyond those topics. We bridge literature that is diverse in both content moderation subject matter, such as malware, spam, hate speech, terrorist content, and enterprise policy compliance, as well as intended deployments, including not only privacy-preserving content moderation for messaging, email, and cloud storage, but also private introspection of encrypted web traffic by middleboxes. In this work, we systematize the study of content moderation in E2EE settings. We set out a process pipeline for content moderation, drawing on a broad interdisciplinary literature that is not specific to E2EE. We examine cryptography and policy design choices at all stages of this pipeline, and we suggest areas of future research to fill gaps in literature and better understand possible paths forward.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e", "custom_clean": 1, "custom_lists": [], "custom_lists_ids": null, "custom_read_date": null, "custom_reading_list": 1, "custom_types": "Paper", "flags": 1, "has_cover": 1, "id": 340, "identifier_ids": "1113", "identifiers": [{"book": 340, "id": 1113, "name": "arXiv", "path": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.03979", "sort": "arxiv", "type": "arxiv", "val": "2303.03979"}], "isbn": null, "language_ids": "1", "languages": [{"avg_rating": 8.429245283018869, "count": 341, "id": 1, "name": "ENG", "sort": "ENG"}], "last_modified": "2023-07-16 18:56:10.618541+00:00", "order_by": "2023-05-23 12:48:00.634174+00:00", "path": "Sarah Scheffler/SoK_ Content Moderation for End-to- (340)", "pubdate": "2023-03-08", "publisher_ids": "125", "publishers": [{"avg_rating": null, "count": 9, "id": 125, "name": "arXiv", "sort": "arXiv"}], "rating": null, "series": [], "series_ids": null, "size": 1598984, "tag_ids": "191,350,351,352", "tags": [{"avg_rating": 7.857142857142857, "count": 28, "id": 191, "name": "Computer Science", "sort": 28}, {"avg_rating": null, "count": 1, "id": 350, "name": "End-to-End Encryption", "sort": 1}, {"avg_rating": null, "count": 1, "id": 351, "name": "Content Moderation", "sort": 1}, {"avg_rating": null, "count": 1, "id": 352, "name": "Privacy", "sort": 1}], "timestamp": "2023-05-23 12:48:00.634174+00:00", "title": "SoK: Content Moderation for End-to-End Encryption"}, {"author_ids": "379,380", "authors": [{"avg_rating": 8.0, "count": 1, "id": 380, "name": "Sophie Debenedetto", "sort": "Debenedetto, Sophie"}, {"avg_rating": 8.0, "count": 1, "id": 379, "name": "Bruce A.

Normale mensen van Sally Rooney is een verhaal over de diepgaande invloed die geliefden op elkaars leven hebben, en het groeiende besef daarvan naarmate de jaren verstrijken. Een intense roman die je je eigen liefdes laat herbeleven. \u2018Het is vooral in de bespiegelingen van beide hoofdpersonen dat Rooney haar verbijsterende meesterschap toont.\u2019 \u2013 de Volkskrant \u2018Opnieuw schittert deze zelfverzekerde Ierse schrijver met een kalme roman waarin een onderhuids drama schuilt. \u2013 NRC Handelsblad \u2018In bedrieglijk vanzelfsprekend proza dat zijn technisch vernuft soms welhaast verlegen lijkt te willen verbergen, tekent Rooney de eerste jongeren die weten dat ze het slechter zullen hebben dan hun ouders als een groep die zich, met het eigen gevoelsleven als enige houvast, een weg moet zoeken in een wereld die ideologisch en economisch op losse schroeven staat.\u2019 \u2013 Humo \u2018Meer! denk je, als het uit is. Nog meer! Niet stoppen!\u2019 \u2013 De Groene Amsterdammer \u2018En schrijven kan Rooney. Haar lezen is een ongemeen spannende ervaring. Rooney\u2019s originaliteit schuilt in haar sensitiviteit en inzicht.

Imbued with Aldo\u0027s insatiable passion and eagerness to teach others, Wine Simple is accessible, deeply educational, and lively and fun, both in voice and visuals. This essential guide begins with the fundamentals of wine in easy-to-absorb hits of information and pragmatic, everyday tips\u2014key varietals and winemaking regions, how to taste, when to save and when to splurge, and how to set up a wine tasting at home. Aldo then teaches you how to take your wine knowledge to the next level and evolve your palate, including techniques on building a\u00a0\u201cflavor library,\u201d\u00a0a cheat sheet to good (and great) vintages (and why you shouldn\u0027t put everything on the line for them), tips on troubleshooting tricky wines (corked? mousy?), and, for the daring, even how to saber a bottle of champagne.

We learn the unvarnished truth, often for the first time, about some of the most iconic triumphs and infamous disasters in Valley history, from the comedy of errors at the birth of Apple to the avalanche of venture money that fostered hubris at WeWork and Uber.\u00a0 VCs\u2019 relentless search for grand slams brews an obsession with the ideal of the lone entrepreneur-genius, and companies seen as potential \u201cunicorns\u201d are given intoxicating amounts of power, with sometimes disastrous results. On a more systemic level, the need to make outsized bets on unproven talent reinforces bias, with women and minorities still represented at woefully low levels. This does not just have social justice implications: as Mallaby relates, China\u2019s homegrown VC sector, having learned at the Valley\u2019s feet, is exploding and now has more women VC luminaries than America has ever had. Still, Silicon Valley VC remains the top incubator of business innovation anywhere\u2014it is not where ideas come from so much as where they go to become the products and companies that create the future. By taking us so deeply into the VCs\u2019 game, The Power Law helps us think about our own future through their eyes.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e", "custom_clean": 1, "custom_lists": [], "custom_lists_ids": null, "custom_read_date": null, "custom_reading_list": 1, "custom_types": "eBook", "flags": 1, "has_cover": 1, "id": 257, "identifier_ids": "879,880", "identifiers": [{"book": 257, "id": 880, "name": "ISBN", "path": "https://www.worldcat.org/isbn/9780525560005", "sort": "isbn", "type": "isbn", "val": "9780525560005"}, {"book": 257, "id": 879, "name": "Google Books", "path": "https://books.google.com/books?id=a3YsEAAAQBAJ", "sort": "google", "type": "google", "val": "a3YsEAAAQBAJ"}], "isbn": "9780525560005", "language_ids": "1", "languages": [{"avg_rating": 8.429245283018869, "count": 341, "id": 1, "name": "ENG", "sort": "ENG"}], "last_modified": "2023-07-21 14:34:52.350604+00:00", "order_by": "2023-01-27 19:15:58.396903+00:00", "path": "Sebastian Mallaby/The Power Law_ Venture Capital and (257)", "pubdate": "2022-02-01", "publisher_ids": "90", "publishers": [{"avg_rating": 8.8, "count": 20, "id": 90, "name": "Penguin Random House", "sort": "Penguin Random House"}], "rating": null, "series": [], "series_ids": null, "size": 12214615, "tag_ids": "11,191,245,246", "tags": [{"avg_rating": 7.857142857142857, "count": 28, "id": 191, "name": "Computer Science", "sort": 28}, {"avg_rating": 8.2, "count": 13, "id": 11, "name": "Business \u0026 Economics", "sort": 13}, {"avg_rating": 10.0, "count": 2, "id": 245, "name": "Corporate Finance", "sort": 2}, {"avg_rating": 10.0, "count": 2, "id": 246, "name": "Venture Capital", "sort": 2}], "timestamp": "2023-01-27 19:15:58.396903+00:00", "title": "The Power Law: Venture Capital and the Making of the New Future"}, {"author_ids": "343", "authors": [{"avg_rating": 8.0, "count": 1, "id": 343, "name": "Sam Harris", "sort": "Harris, Sam"}], "comments": "\u003cdiv\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eProduct Description\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor the millions of Americans who want spirituality without religion, Sam Harris\u2019s latest New York Times bestseller is a guide to meditation as a rational practice informed by neuroscience and psychology.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom Sam Harris, neuroscientist and author of numerous New York Times bestselling books, Waking Up is for the twenty percent of Americans who follow no religion but who suspect that important truths can be found in the experiences of such figures as Jesus, the Buddha, Lao Tzu, Rumi, and the other saints and sages of history.

An acronym for \"Phenethylamines I Have Known and Loved\", the book spans autobiography, organic chemistry, politics, ethnobotany, and psychopharmacology, and the cultural impact is likely to be profound for decades to come, as it has already. PiHKAL is divided into two parts, the first of which is a fictionalized autobiographical \u0027novel\u0027 - the main fiction is that it is fiction. This first half of the book is The Love Story, about two people named Shura and Alice who fall in love, though one of them is already in love with someone else. This love triangle is a painful ordeal they must go through, and that process unfolds before the reader with grace and great insight into human nature. Shura is a brilliant chemist who has dedicated his career to making psychoactive drugs, in the story they go through many experiences with the psychedelic compounds that Shura has discovered and has made in his lab, all of which have been bioassayed himself. The reader will find themselves going on this journey with them, experiencing what they experienced, both in their hearts and in the psychedelic journeys they have. The second half of PiHKAL is called The Chemical Story, and it contains detailed instructions for, and effects of, the synthesis of 179 psychedelic phenethylamines which were mostly discovered by Shulgin himself. For each substance there is information on its synthesis, suggested effective dosage, duration, and detailed commentary on the subjective effects that were experienced. This book appeals to adults of all ages and cultures, and to the psychedelically experienced and inexperienced alike.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e", "custom_clean": 1, "custom_lists": [], "custom_lists_ids": null, "custom_read_date": null, "custom_reading_list": 1, "custom_types": "eBook", "flags": 1, "has_cover": 1, "id": 252, "identifier_ids": "864,865,863", "identifiers": [{"book": 252, "id": 863, "name": "ISBN", "path": "https://www.worldcat.org/isbn/9780963009609", "sort": "isbn", "type": "isbn", "val": "9780963009609"}, {"book": 252, "id": 865, "name": "Google Books", "path": "https://books.google.com/books?id=O8AdHBGybpcC", "sort": "google", "type": "google", "val": "O8AdHBGybpcC"}, {"book": 252, "id": 864, "name": "Goodreads", "path": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/886113", "sort": "goodreads", "type": "goodreads", "val": "886113"}], "isbn": "9780963009609", "language_ids": "1", "languages": [{"avg_rating": 8.429245283018869, "count": 341, "id": 1, "name": "ENG", "sort": "ENG"}], "last_modified": "2023-03-25 22:02:03.254144+00:00", "order_by": "2023-01-03 18:10:07.521546+00:00", "path": "Alexander Shulgin/Pihkal_ A Chemical Love Story (252)", "pubdate": "1990-10-01", "publisher_ids": "153", "publishers": [{"avg_rating": 8.0, "count": 1, "id": 153, "name": "Transform Press", "sort": "Transform Press"}], "rating": 4, "series": [], "series_ids": null, "size": 1271874, "tag_ids": "43,92,239,241,242", "tags": [{"avg_rating": 8.222222222222221, "count": 31, "id": 92, "name": "Biography", "sort": 31}, {"avg_rating": 8.0, "count": 27, "id": 43, "name": "Self Help", "sort": 27}, {"avg_rating": 8.0, "count": 1, "id": 239, "name": "Personal Memoirs", "sort": 1}, {"avg_rating": 8.0, "count": 1, "id": 241, "name": "Substance Abuse \u0026 Addictions", "sort": 1}, {"avg_rating": 8.0, "count": 1, "id": 242, "name": "Drugs", "sort": 1}], "timestamp": "2023-01-03 18:10:07.521546+00:00", "title": "Pihkal: A Chemical Love Story"}, {"author_ids": "335", "authors": [{"avg_rating": 8.0, "count": 1, "id": 335, "name": "Tony Fadell", "sort": "Fadell, Tony"}], "comments": "\u003cdiv\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWritten for anyone who wants to grow at work\u2014from young grads navigating their first jobs to CEOs deciding whether to sell their company\u2014 Build is full of personal stories, practical advice and fascinating insights into some of the most impactful products and people of the 20th century.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEach quick 5-20 page entry builds on the previous one, charting Tony\u2019s personal journey from a product designer to a leader, from a startup founder to an executive to a mentor.

These models have obtained state-of-the-art results on datasets and tasks where large training sets are available. However, they do not transfer well to new applications with no training data, and are outperformed by unsupervised term-frequency methods such as BM25. In this work, we explore the limits of contrastive learning as a way to train unsupervised dense retrievers and show that it leads to strong performance in various retrieval settings. On the BEIR benchmark our unsupervised model outperforms BM25 on 11 out of 15 datasets for the Recall@100. When used as pre-training before fine-tuning, either on a few thousands in-domain examples or on the large MS~MARCO dataset, our contrastive model leads to improvements on the BEIR benchmark. Finally, we evaluate our approach for multi-lingual retrieval, where training data is even scarcer than for English, and show that our approach leads to strong unsupervised performance. Our model also exhibits strong cross-lingual transfer when fine-tuned on supervised English data only and evaluated on low resources language such as Swahili. We show that our unsupervised models can perform cross-lingual retrieval between different scripts, such as retrieving English documents from Arabic queries, which would not be possible with term matching methods.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e", "custom_clean": 1, "custom_lists": [{"id": 3, "sort": "Machine Learning.Deep Learning", "value": "Machine Learning.Deep Learning"}], "custom_lists_ids": "3", "custom_read_date": null, "custom_reading_list": 1, "custom_types": "Paper", "flags": 1, "has_cover": 1, "id": 247, "identifier_ids": "927", "identifiers": [{"book": 247, "id": 927, "name": "arXiv", "path": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.09118", "sort": "arxiv", "type": "arxiv", "val": "2112.09118"}], "isbn": null, "language_ids": "1", "languages": [{"avg_rating": 8.429245283018869, "count": 341, "id": 1, "name": "ENG", "sort": "ENG"}], "last_modified": "2023-03-16 22:08:36.421370+00:00", "order_by": "2022-12-05 19:21:52.360004+00:00", "path": "Gautier Izacard/Unsupervised Dense Information Retr (247)", "pubdate": "2022-12-05", "publisher_ids": "125", "publishers": [{"avg_rating": null, "count": 9, "id": 125, "name": "arXiv", "sort": "arXiv"}], "rating": null, "series": [], "series_ids": null, "size": 686136, "tag_ids": "186,189,191,237", "tags": [{"avg_rating": 7.857142857142857, "count": 28, "id": 191, "name": "Computer Science", "sort": 28}, {"avg_rating": null, "count": 11, "id": 189, "name": "Deep Learning", "sort": 11}, {"avg_rating": null, "count": 10, "id": 186, "name": "Machine Learning", "sort": 10}, {"avg_rating": null, "count": 1, "id": 237, "name": "Information Retrieval", "sort": 1}], "timestamp": "2022-12-05 19:21:52.360004+00:00", "title": "Unsupervised Dense Information Retrieval with Contrastive Learning"}, {"author_ids": "312", "authors": [{"avg_rating": 8.0, "count": 1, "id": 312, "name": "John Maeda", "sort": "Maeda, John"}], "comments": "\u003cdiv\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTen laws of simplicity for business, technology, and design that teach us how to need less but get more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally, we are learning that simplicity equals sanity.

We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer, based solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely. Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.8 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature.

In order to clarify the intended use cases of machine learning models and minimize their usage in contexts for which they are not well suited, we recommend that released models be accompanied by documentation detailing their performance characteristics. In this paper, we propose a framework that we call model cards, to encourage such transparent model reporting. Model cards are short documents accompanying trained machine learning models that provide benchmarked evaluation in a variety of conditions, such as across different cultural, demographic, or phenotypic groups (e.g., race, geographic location, sex, Fitzpatrick skin type) and intersectional groups (e.g., age and race, or sex and Fitzpatrick skin type) that are relevant to the intended application domains. Model cards also disclose the context in which models are intended to be used, details of the performance evaluation procedures, and other relevant information. While we focus primarily on human-centered machine learning models in the application fields of computer vision and natural language processing, this framework can be used to document any trained machine learning model. To solidify the concept, we provide cards for two supervised models: One trained to detect smiling faces in images, and one trained to detect toxic comments in text. We propose model cards as a step towards the responsible democratization of machine learning and related AI technology, increasing transparency into how well AI technology works. We hope this work encourages those releasing trained machine learning models to accompany model releases with similar detailed evaluation numbers and other relevant documentation.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e", "custom_clean": 1, "custom_lists": [{"id": 3, "sort": "Machine Learning.Deep Learning", "value": "Machine Learning.Deep Learning"}], "custom_lists_ids": "3", "custom_read_date": null, "custom_reading_list": 1, "custom_types": "Paper", "flags": 1, "has_cover": 1, "id": 239, "identifier_ids": "835", "identifiers": [{"book": 239, "id": 835, "name": "arXiv", "path": "https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.03993", "sort": "arxiv", "type": "arxiv", "val": "1810.03993"}], "isbn": null, "language_ids": "1", "languages": [{"avg_rating": 8.429245283018869, "count": 341, "id": 1, "name": "ENG", "sort": "ENG"}], "last_modified": "2023-01-27 19:20:40.603931+00:00", "order_by": "2022-10-12 20:13:38.586617+00:00", "path": "Margaret Mitchell/Model Cards for Model Reporting (239)", "pubdate": "2018-10-05", "publisher_ids": "125", "publishers": [{"avg_rating": null, "count": 9, "id": 125, "name": "arXiv", "sort": "arXiv"}], "rating": null, "series": [], "series_ids": null, "size": 995470, "tag_ids": "186,189,191", "tags": [{"avg_rating": 7.857142857142857, "count": 28, "id": 191, "name": "Computer Science", "sort": 28}, {"avg_rating": null, "count": 11, "id": 189, "name": "Deep Learning", "sort": 11}, {"avg_rating": null, "count": 10, "id": 186, "name": "Machine Learning", "sort": 10}], "timestamp": "2022-10-12 20:13:38.586617+00:00", "title": "Model Cards for Model Reporting"}, {"author_ids": "220,222,287,288,289,290", "authors": [{"avg_rating": null, "count": 1, "id": 289, "name": "Greg Brockman", "sort": "Brockman, Greg"}, {"avg_rating": null, "count": 2, "id": 220, "name": "Jong Wook Kim", "sort": "Kim, Jong Wook"}, {"avg_rating": null, "count": 1, "id": 290, "name": "Christine McLeavey", "sort": "McLeavey, Christine"}, {"avg_rating": null, "count": 1, "id": 287, "name": "Alex Radford", "sort": "Radford, Alex"}, {"avg_rating": null, "count": 2, "id": 222, "name": "Ilya Sutskever", "sort": "Sutskever, Ilya"}, {"avg_rating": null, "count": 1, "id": 288, "name": "Tao Xu", "sort": "Xu, Tao"}], "comments": "\u003cdiv\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe study the capabilities of speech processing systems trained simply to predict large amounts of transcripts of audio on the internet.

We are releasing models and inference code to serve as a foundation for further work on robust speech processing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAvailable: https://openai.com/blog/whisper/\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u00a0\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e", "custom_clean": 1, "custom_lists": [{"id": 3, "sort": "Machine Learning.Deep Learning", "value": "Machine Learning.Deep Learning"}], "custom_lists_ids": "3", "custom_read_date": null, "custom_reading_list": 1, "custom_types": "Paper", "flags": 1, "has_cover": 1, "id": 238, "identifier_ids": "1408", "identifiers": [{"book": 238, "id": 1408, "name": "arXiv", "path": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.04356", "sort": "arxiv", "type": "arxiv", "val": "2212.04356"}], "isbn": null, "language_ids": "1", "languages": [{"avg_rating": 8.429245283018869, "count": 341, "id": 1, "name": "ENG", "sort": "ENG"}], "last_modified": "2023-07-21 17:48:28.587052+00:00", "order_by": "2022-10-12 20:13:38.408058+00:00", "path": "Alex Radford/Robust Speech Recognition via Large (238)", "pubdate": "2022-09-21", "publisher_ids": "125", "publishers": [{"avg_rating": null, "count": 9, "id": 125, "name": "arXiv", "sort": "arXiv"}], "rating": null, "series": [], "series_ids": null, "size": 853124, "tag_ids": "186,189,191", "tags": [{"avg_rating": 7.857142857142857, "count": 28, "id": 191, "name": "Computer Science", "sort": 28}, {"avg_rating": null, "count": 11, "id": 189, "name": "Deep Learning", "sort": 11}, {"avg_rating": null, "count": 10, "id": 186, "name": "Machine Learning", "sort": 10}], "timestamp": "2022-10-12 20:13:38.408058+00:00", "title": "Robust Speech Recognition via Large-Scale Weak Supervision"}, {"author_ids": "262", "authors": [{"avg_rating": 6.0, "count": 1, "id": 262, "name": "Lazy Programmer", "sort": "Programmer, Lazy"}], "comments": "\u003cdiv\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDeep learning is making waves. At the time of this writing (March 2016), Google\u2019s AlghaGo program just beat 9-dan professional Go player Lee Sedol at the game of Go, a Chinese board game.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eExperts in the field of Artificial Intelligence thought we were 10 years away from achieving a victory against a top professional Go player, but progress seems to have accelerated!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile deep learning is a complex subject, it is not any more difficult to learn than any other machine learning algorithm. I wrote this book to introduce you to the basics of neural networks. You will get along fine with undergraduate-level math and programming skill.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll the materials in this book can be downloaded and installed for free. We will use the Python programming language, along with the numerical computing library Numpy. I will also show you in the later chapters how to build a deep network using Theano and TensorFlow, which are libraries built specifically for deep learning and can accelerate computation by taking advantage of the GPU.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnlike other machine learning algorithms, deep learning is particularly powerful because it automatically learns features. That means you don\u2019t need to spend your time trying to come up with and test \u201ckernels\u201d or \u201cinteraction effects\u201d - something only statisticians love to do. Instead, we will let the neural network learn these things for us. Each layer of the neural network learns a different abstraction than the previous layers. For example, in image classification, the first layer might learn different strokes, and in the next layer put the strokes together to learn shapes, and in the next layer put the shapes together to form facial features, and in the next layer have a high level representation of faces.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn top of all this, deep learning is known for winning its fair share Kaggle contests. These are machine learning contests that are open to anyone in the world who are allowed to use any machine learning technique they want. Deep learning is that powerful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDo you want a gentle introduction to this \u201cdark art\u201d, with practical code examples that you can try right away and apply to your own data? Then this book is for you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWho is this book NOT for?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDeep Learning and Neural Networks are usually taught at the upper-year undergraduate level. That should give you some idea of the type of knowledge you need to understand this kind of material.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou absolutely need exposure to calculus to understand deep learning, no matter how simple the instructor makes things. Linear algebra would help. I will assume familiarity with Python (although it is an easy language to pick up). You will need to have some concept of machine learning. If you know about algorithms like logistic regression already, this book is perfect for you. If not, you might want to check out my \u201cprerequisites\u201d book, at: http://amzn.com/B01D7GDRQ2\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the other hand, this book is more like a casual primer than a dry textbook. If you are looking for material on more advanced topics, like LSTMs, convolutional neural networks, or reinforcement learning, I have online courses that teach this material, for example: https://www.udemy.com/deep-learning-c...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNew libraries like TensorFlow are being updated constantly. This is not an encyclopedia for these libraries (as such a thing would be impossible to keep up to date). In the one (1!!!) month since the book was first published, no less than THREE new wrapper libraries for TensorFlow have been released to make coding deep networks easier.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e", "custom_clean": 1, "custom_lists": [{"id": 1, "sort": "Programming.Python", "value": "Programming.Python"}], "custom_lists_ids": "1", "custom_read_date": null, "custom_reading_list": 1, "custom_types": "eBook", "flags": 1, "has_cover": 1, "id": 226, "identifier_ids": "842,843", "identifiers": [{"book": 226, "id": 843, "name": "Goodreads", "path": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29496091", "sort": "goodreads", "type": "goodreads", "val": "29496091"}, {"book": 226, "id": 842, "name": "Amazon", "path": "https://amazon.com/dp/B01CVJ19E8", "sort": "amazon", "type": "amazon", "val": "B01CVJ19E8"}], "isbn": null, "language_ids": "1", "languages": [{"avg_rating": 8.429245283018869, "count": 341, "id": 1, "name": "ENG", "sort": "ENG"}], "last_modified": "2023-07-21 18:05:25.156019+00:00", "order_by": "2022-10-08 20:04:04+00:00", "path": "Lazy Programmer/Deep Learning in Python_ Master Dat (226)", "pubdate": "2016-03-11", "publisher_ids": "117", "publishers": [{"avg_rating": 7.6, "count": 15, "id": 117, "name": "Independently Published", "sort": "Independently Published"}], "rating": 3, "series": [], "series_ids": null, "size": 208267, "tag_ids": "190,217", "tags": [{"avg_rating": 7.714285714285714, "count": 30, "id": 190, "name": "Programming", "sort": 30}, {"avg_rating": 7.714285714285714, "count": 9, "id": 217, "name": "Python", "sort": 9}], "timestamp": "2022-10-08 20:04:04+00:00", "title": "Deep Learning in Python: Master Data Science and Machine Learning With Modern Neural Networks Written in Python, Theano, and TensorFlow (Machine Learning in Python)"}, {"author_ids": "174,176,184", "authors": [{"avg_rating": 8.0, "count": 4, "id": 176, "name": "Jack Cohen", "sort": "Cohen, Jack"}, {"avg_rating": 9.166666666666666, "count": 86, "id": 174, "name": "Terry Pratchett", "sort": "Pratchett, Terry"}, {"avg_rating": 8.0, "count": 4, "id": 184, "name": "Ian Stewart", "sort": "Stewart, Ian"}], "comments": "\u003cdiv\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe fantastic first book in the Sunday Times bestselling Science of Discworld series\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen a wizardly experiment goes adrift, the wizards of Unseen University find themselves with a pocket universe on their hands: Roundworld, where neither magic nor common sense seems to stand a chance against logic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Universe, of course, is our own.

These important advances for security and privacy create new content moderation challenges for online services, because services can no longer directly access plaintext content. While ongoing public policy debates about E2EE and content moderation in the United States and European Union emphasize child sexual abuse material and misinformation in messaging and storage, we identify and synthesize a wealth of scholarship that goes far beyond those topics. We bridge literature that is diverse in both content moderation subject matter, such as malware, spam, hate speech, terrorist content, and enterprise policy compliance, as well as intended deployments, including not only privacy-preserving content moderation for messaging, email, and cloud storage, but also private introspection of encrypted web traffic by middleboxes. In this work, we systematize the study of content moderation in E2EE settings. We set out a process pipeline for content moderation, drawing on a broad interdisciplinary literature that is not specific to E2EE. We examine cryptography and policy design choices at all stages of this pipeline, and we suggest areas of future research to fill gaps in literature and better understand possible paths forward.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e", "custom_clean": 1, "custom_lists": [], "custom_lists_ids": null, "custom_read_date": null, "custom_reading_list": 1, "custom_types": "Paper", "flags": 1, "has_cover": 1, "id": 340, "identifier_ids": "1113", "identifiers": [{"book": 340, "id": 1113, "name": "arXiv", "path": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.03979", "sort": "arxiv", "type": "arxiv", "val": "2303.03979"}], "isbn": null, "language_ids": "1", "languages": [{"avg_rating": 8.429245283018869, "count": 341, "id": 1, "name": "ENG", "sort": "ENG"}], "last_modified": "2023-07-16 18:56:10.618541+00:00", "order_by": "2023-05-23 12:48:00.634174+00:00", "path": "Sarah Scheffler/SoK_ Content Moderation for End-to- (340)", "pubdate": "2023-03-08", "publisher_ids": "125", "publishers": [{"avg_rating": null, "count": 9, "id": 125, "name": "arXiv", "sort": "arXiv"}], "rating": null, "series": [], "series_ids": null, "size": 1598984, "tag_ids": "191,350,351,352", "tags": [{"avg_rating": 7.857142857142857, "count": 28, "id": 191, "name": "Computer Science", "sort": 28}, {"avg_rating": null, "count": 1, "id": 350, "name": "End-to-End Encryption", "sort": 1}, {"avg_rating": null, "count": 1, "id": 351, "name": "Content Moderation", "sort": 1}, {"avg_rating": null, "count": 1, "id": 352, "name": "Privacy", "sort": 1}], "timestamp": "2023-05-23 12:48:00.634174+00:00", "title": "SoK: Content Moderation for End-to-End Encryption"}, {"author_ids": "379,380", "authors": [{"avg_rating": 8.0, "count": 1, "id": 380, "name": "Sophie Debenedetto", "sort": "Debenedetto, Sophie"}, {"avg_rating": 8.0, "count": 1, "id": 379, "name": "Bruce A.

Using Hanna and Jack\u2019s story, Wodtke walks readers through how to inspire a diverse team to work together in pursuit of a single, challenging goal, and how to stay motivated despite setbacks and failures.Radical Focus has been translated into six languages and sold more than 50,000 copies.

He\u0027s worked with celebrated chef Eric Ripert as wine director of three-Michelin-starred Le Bernardin for over a decade, yet his philosophy and approach to wine is much more casual. Aldo\u0027s debut book, Wine Simple, is full of confidence-building infographics and illustrations, an unbeatable depth of knowledge, effusive encouragement, and, most important, strong opinions on wine so you can learn to form your own. Imbued with Aldo\u0027s insatiable passion and eagerness to teach others, Wine Simple is accessible, deeply educational, and lively and fun, both in voice and visuals. This essential guide begins with the fundamentals of wine in easy-to-absorb hits of information and pragmatic, everyday tips\u2014key varietals and winemaking regions, how to taste, when to save and when to splurge, and how to set up a wine tasting at home. Aldo then teaches you how to take your wine knowledge to the next level and evolve your palate, including techniques on building a\u00a0\u201cflavor library,\u201d\u00a0a cheat sheet to good (and great) vintages (and why you shouldn\u0027t put everything on the line for them), tips on troubleshooting tricky wines (corked? mousy?), and, for the daring, even how to saber a bottle of champagne.

When it comes to improbable innovations, a legendary tech VC told Sebastian Mallaby, the future cannot be predicted, it can only be discovered. It is the nature of the venture-capital game that most attempts at discovery fail, but a very few succeed at such a scale that they more than make up for everything else. That extreme ratio of success and failure is the power law that drives the VC business, all of Silicon Valley, the wider tech sector, and, by extension, the world.\u00a0\u00a0 In The Power Law, Sebastian Mallaby has parlayed unprecedented access to the most celebrated venture capitalists of all time\u2014the key figures at Sequoia, Kleiner Perkins, Accel, Benchmark, and Andreessen Horowitz, as well as Chinese partnerships such as Qiming and Capital Today\u2014into a riveting blend of storytelling and analysis that unfurls the history of tech incubation, in the Valley and ultimately worldwide. We learn the unvarnished truth, often for the first time, about some of the most iconic triumphs and infamous disasters in Valley history, from the comedy of errors at the birth of Apple to the avalanche of venture money that fostered hubris at WeWork and Uber.\u00a0 VCs\u2019 relentless search for grand slams brews an obsession with the ideal of the lone entrepreneur-genius, and companies seen as potential \u201cunicorns\u201d are given intoxicating amounts of power, with sometimes disastrous results. On a more systemic level, the need to make outsized bets on unproven talent reinforces bias, with women and minorities still represented at woefully low levels. This does not just have social justice implications: as Mallaby relates, China\u2019s homegrown VC sector, having learned at the Valley\u2019s feet, is exploding and now has more women VC luminaries than America has ever had. Still, Silicon Valley VC remains the top incubator of business innovation anywhere\u2014it is not where ideas come from so much as where they go to become the products and companies that create the future.

An acronym for \"Phenethylamines I Have Known and Loved\", the book spans autobiography, organic chemistry, politics, ethnobotany, and psychopharmacology, and the cultural impact is likely to be profound for decades to come, as it has already. PiHKAL is divided into two parts, the first of which is a fictionalized autobiographical \u0027novel\u0027 - the main fiction is that it is fiction. This first half of the book is The Love Story, about two people named Shura and Alice who fall in love, though one of them is already in love with someone else. This love triangle is a painful ordeal they must go through, and that process unfolds before the reader with grace and great insight into human nature. Shura is a brilliant chemist who has dedicated his career to making psychoactive drugs, in the story they go through many experiences with the psychedelic compounds that Shura has discovered and has made in his lab, all of which have been bioassayed himself. The reader will find themselves going on this journey with them, experiencing what they experienced, both in their hearts and in the psychedelic journeys they have. The second half of PiHKAL is called The Chemical Story, and it contains detailed instructions for, and effects of, the synthesis of 179 psychedelic phenethylamines which were mostly discovered by Shulgin himself. For each substance there is information on its synthesis, suggested effective dosage, duration, and detailed commentary on the subjective effects that were experienced. This book appeals to adults of all ages and cultures, and to the psychedelically experienced and inexperienced alike.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e", "custom_clean": 1, "custom_lists": [], "custom_lists_ids": null, "custom_read_date": null, "custom_reading_list": 1, "custom_types": "eBook", "flags": 1, "has_cover": 1, "id": 252, "identifier_ids": "864,865,863", "identifiers": [{"book": 252, "id": 863, "name": "ISBN", "path": "https://www.worldcat.org/isbn/9780963009609", "sort": "isbn", "type": "isbn", "val": "9780963009609"}, {"book": 252, "id": 865, "name": "Google Books", "path": "https://books.google.com/books?id=O8AdHBGybpcC", "sort": "google", "type": "google", "val": "O8AdHBGybpcC"}, {"book": 252, "id": 864, "name": "Goodreads", "path": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/886113", "sort": "goodreads", "type": "goodreads", "val": "886113"}], "isbn": "9780963009609", "language_ids": "1", "languages": [{"avg_rating": 8.429245283018869, "count": 341, "id": 1, "name": "ENG", "sort": "ENG"}], "last_modified": "2023-03-25 22:02:03.254144+00:00", "order_by": "2023-01-03 18:10:07.521546+00:00", "path": "Alexander Shulgin/Pihkal_ A Chemical Love Story (252)", "pubdate": "1990-10-01", "publisher_ids": "153", "publishers": [{"avg_rating": 8.0, "count": 1, "id": 153, "name": "Transform Press", "sort": "Transform Press"}], "rating": 4, "series": [], "series_ids": null, "size": 1271874, "tag_ids": "43,92,239,241,242", "tags": [{"avg_rating": 8.222222222222221, "count": 31, "id": 92, "name": "Biography", "sort": 31}, {"avg_rating": 8.0, "count": 27, "id": 43, "name": "Self Help", "sort": 27}, {"avg_rating": 8.0, "count": 1, "id": 239, "name": "Personal Memoirs", "sort": 1}, {"avg_rating": 8.0, "count": 1, "id": 241, "name": "Substance Abuse \u0026 Addictions", "sort": 1}, {"avg_rating": 8.0, "count": 1, "id": 242, "name": "Drugs", "sort": 1}], "timestamp": "2023-01-03 18:10:07.521546+00:00", "title": "Pihkal: A Chemical Love Story"}, {"author_ids": "335", "authors": [{"avg_rating": 8.0, "count": 1, "id": 335, "name": "Tony Fadell", "sort": "Fadell, Tony"}], "comments": "\u003cdiv\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWritten for anyone who wants to grow at work\u2014from young grads navigating their first jobs to CEOs deciding whether to sell their company\u2014 Build is full of personal stories, practical advice and fascinating insights into some of the most impactful products and people of the 20th century.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEach quick 5-20 page entry builds on the previous one, charting Tony\u2019s personal journey from a product designer to a leader, from a startup founder to an executive to a mentor.

These models have obtained state-of-the-art results on datasets and tasks where large training sets are available. However, they do not transfer well to new applications with no training data, and are outperformed by unsupervised term-frequency methods such as BM25. In this work, we explore the limits of contrastive learning as a way to train unsupervised dense retrievers and show that it leads to strong performance in various retrieval settings. On the BEIR benchmark our unsupervised model outperforms BM25 on 11 out of 15 datasets for the Recall@100. When used as pre-training before fine-tuning, either on a few thousands in-domain examples or on the large MS~MARCO dataset, our contrastive model leads to improvements on the BEIR benchmark. Finally, we evaluate our approach for multi-lingual retrieval, where training data is even scarcer than for English, and show that our approach leads to strong unsupervised performance. Our model also exhibits strong cross-lingual transfer when fine-tuned on supervised English data only and evaluated on low resources language such as Swahili. We show that our unsupervised models can perform cross-lingual retrieval between different scripts, such as retrieving English documents from Arabic queries, which would not be possible with term matching methods.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e", "custom_clean": 1, "custom_lists": [{"id": 3, "sort": "Machine Learning.Deep Learning", "value": "Machine Learning.Deep Learning"}], "custom_lists_ids": "3", "custom_read_date": null, "custom_reading_list": 1, "custom_types": "Paper", "flags": 1, "has_cover": 1, "id": 247, "identifier_ids": "927", "identifiers": [{"book": 247, "id": 927, "name": "arXiv", "path": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.09118", "sort": "arxiv", "type": "arxiv", "val": "2112.09118"}], "isbn": null, "language_ids": "1", "languages": [{"avg_rating": 8.429245283018869, "count": 341, "id": 1, "name": "ENG", "sort": "ENG"}], "last_modified": "2023-03-16 22:08:36.421370+00:00", "order_by": "2022-12-05 19:21:52.360004+00:00", "path": "Gautier Izacard/Unsupervised Dense Information Retr (247)", "pubdate": "2022-12-05", "publisher_ids": "125", "publishers": [{"avg_rating": null, "count": 9, "id": 125, "name": "arXiv", "sort": "arXiv"}], "rating": null, "series": [], "series_ids": null, "size": 686136, "tag_ids": "186,189,191,237", "tags": [{"avg_rating": 7.857142857142857, "count": 28, "id": 191, "name": "Computer Science", "sort": 28}, {"avg_rating": null, "count": 11, "id": 189, "name": "Deep Learning", "sort": 11}, {"avg_rating": null, "count": 10, "id": 186, "name": "Machine Learning", "sort": 10}, {"avg_rating": null, "count": 1, "id": 237, "name": "Information Retrieval", "sort": 1}], "timestamp": "2022-12-05 19:21:52.360004+00:00", "title": "Unsupervised Dense Information Retrieval with Contrastive Learning"}, {"author_ids": "312", "authors": [{"avg_rating": 8.0, "count": 1, "id": 312, "name": "John Maeda", "sort": "Maeda, John"}], "comments": "\u003cdiv\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTen laws of simplicity for business, technology, and design that teach us how to need less but get more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally, we are learning that simplicity equals sanity.

We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer, based solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely. Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.8 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature.

In order to clarify the intended use cases of machine learning models and minimize their usage in contexts for which they are not well suited, we recommend that released models be accompanied by documentation detailing their performance characteristics. In this paper, we propose a framework that we call model cards, to encourage such transparent model reporting. Model cards are short documents accompanying trained machine learning models that provide benchmarked evaluation in a variety of conditions, such as across different cultural, demographic, or phenotypic groups (e.g., race, geographic location, sex, Fitzpatrick skin type) and intersectional groups (e.g., age and race, or sex and Fitzpatrick skin type) that are relevant to the intended application domains. Model cards also disclose the context in which models are intended to be used, details of the performance evaluation procedures, and other relevant information. While we focus primarily on human-centered machine learning models in the application fields of computer vision and natural language processing, this framework can be used to document any trained machine learning model. To solidify the concept, we provide cards for two supervised models: One trained to detect smiling faces in images, and one trained to detect toxic comments in text. We propose model cards as a step towards the responsible democratization of machine learning and related AI technology, increasing transparency into how well AI technology works. We hope this work encourages those releasing trained machine learning models to accompany model releases with similar detailed evaluation numbers and other relevant documentation.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e", "custom_clean": 1, "custom_lists": [{"id": 3, "sort": "Machine Learning.Deep Learning", "value": "Machine Learning.Deep Learning"}], "custom_lists_ids": "3", "custom_read_date": null, "custom_reading_list": 1, "custom_types": "Paper", "flags": 1, "has_cover": 1, "id": 239, "identifier_ids": "835", "identifiers": [{"book": 239, "id": 835, "name": "arXiv", "path": "https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.03993", "sort": "arxiv", "type": "arxiv", "val": "1810.03993"}], "isbn": null, "language_ids": "1", "languages": [{"avg_rating": 8.429245283018869, "count": 341, "id": 1, "name": "ENG", "sort": "ENG"}], "last_modified": "2023-01-27 19:20:40.603931+00:00", "order_by": "2022-10-12 20:13:38.586617+00:00", "path": "Margaret Mitchell/Model Cards for Model Reporting (239)", "pubdate": "2018-10-05", "publisher_ids": "125", "publishers": [{"avg_rating": null, "count": 9, "id": 125, "name": "arXiv", "sort": "arXiv"}], "rating": null, "series": [], "series_ids": null, "size": 995470, "tag_ids": "186,189,191", "tags": [{"avg_rating": 7.857142857142857, "count": 28, "id": 191, "name": "Computer Science", "sort": 28}, {"avg_rating": null, "count": 11, "id": 189, "name": "Deep Learning", "sort": 11}, {"avg_rating": null, "count": 10, "id": 186, "name": "Machine Learning", "sort": 10}], "timestamp": "2022-10-12 20:13:38.586617+00:00", "title": "Model Cards for Model Reporting"}, {"author_ids": "220,222,287,288,289,290", "authors": [{"avg_rating": null, "count": 1, "id": 289, "name": "Greg Brockman", "sort": "Brockman, Greg"}, {"avg_rating": null, "count": 2, "id": 220, "name": "Jong Wook Kim", "sort": "Kim, Jong Wook"}, {"avg_rating": null, "count": 1, "id": 290, "name": "Christine McLeavey", "sort": "McLeavey, Christine"}, {"avg_rating": null, "count": 1, "id": 287, "name": "Alex Radford", "sort": "Radford, Alex"}, {"avg_rating": null, "count": 2, "id": 222, "name": "Ilya Sutskever", "sort": "Sutskever, Ilya"}, {"avg_rating": null, "count": 1, "id": 288, "name": "Tao Xu", "sort": "Xu, Tao"}], "comments": "\u003cdiv\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe study the capabilities of speech processing systems trained simply to predict large amounts of transcripts of audio on the internet.

We are releasing models and inference code to serve as a foundation for further work on robust speech processing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAvailable: https://openai.com/blog/whisper/\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u00a0\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e", "custom_clean": 1, "custom_lists": [{"id": 3, "sort": "Machine Learning.Deep Learning", "value": "Machine Learning.Deep Learning"}], "custom_lists_ids": "3", "custom_read_date": null, "custom_reading_list": 1, "custom_types": "Paper", "flags": 1, "has_cover": 1, "id": 238, "identifier_ids": "1408", "identifiers": [{"book": 238, "id": 1408, "name": "arXiv", "path": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.04356", "sort": "arxiv", "type": "arxiv", "val": "2212.04356"}], "isbn": null, "language_ids": "1", "languages": [{"avg_rating": 8.429245283018869, "count": 341, "id": 1, "name": "ENG", "sort": "ENG"}], "last_modified": "2023-07-21 17:48:28.587052+00:00", "order_by": "2022-10-12 20:13:38.408058+00:00", "path": "Alex Radford/Robust Speech Recognition via Large (238)", "pubdate": "2022-09-21", "publisher_ids": "125", "publishers": [{"avg_rating": null, "count": 9, "id": 125, "name": "arXiv", "sort": "arXiv"}], "rating": null, "series": [], "series_ids": null, "size": 853124, "tag_ids": "186,189,191", "tags": [{"avg_rating": 7.857142857142857, "count": 28, "id": 191, "name": "Computer Science", "sort": 28}, {"avg_rating": null, "count": 11, "id": 189, "name": "Deep Learning", "sort": 11}, {"avg_rating": null, "count": 10, "id": 186, "name": "Machine Learning", "sort": 10}], "timestamp": "2022-10-12 20:13:38.408058+00:00", "title": "Robust Speech Recognition via Large-Scale Weak Supervision"}, {"author_ids": "262", "authors": [{"avg_rating": 6.0, "count": 1, "id": 262, "name": "Lazy Programmer", "sort": "Programmer, Lazy"}], "comments": "\u003cdiv\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDeep learning is making waves. At the time of this writing (March 2016), Google\u2019s AlghaGo program just beat 9-dan professional Go player Lee Sedol at the game of Go, a Chinese board game.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eExperts in the field of Artificial Intelligence thought we were 10 years away from achieving a victory against a top professional Go player, but progress seems to have accelerated!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile deep learning is a complex subject, it is not any more difficult to learn than any other machine learning algorithm. I wrote this book to introduce you to the basics of neural networks. You will get along fine with undergraduate-level math and programming skill.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll the materials in this book can be downloaded and installed for free. We will use the Python programming language, along with the numerical computing library Numpy. I will also show you in the later chapters how to build a deep network using Theano and TensorFlow, which are libraries built specifically for deep learning and can accelerate computation by taking advantage of the GPU.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnlike other machine learning algorithms, deep learning is particularly powerful because it automatically learns features. That means you don\u2019t need to spend your time trying to come up with and test \u201ckernels\u201d or \u201cinteraction effects\u201d - something only statisticians love to do. Instead, we will let the neural network learn these things for us. Each layer of the neural network learns a different abstraction than the previous layers. For example, in image classification, the first layer might learn different strokes, and in the next layer put the strokes together to learn shapes, and in the next layer put the shapes together to form facial features, and in the next layer have a high level representation of faces.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn top of all this, deep learning is known for winning its fair share Kaggle contests. These are machine learning contests that are open to anyone in the world who are allowed to use any machine learning technique they want. Deep learning is that powerful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDo you want a gentle introduction to this \u201cdark art\u201d, with practical code examples that you can try right away and apply to your own data? Then this book is for you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWho is this book NOT for?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDeep Learning and Neural Networks are usually taught at the upper-year undergraduate level. That should give you some idea of the type of knowledge you need to understand this kind of material.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou absolutely need exposure to calculus to understand deep learning, no matter how simple the instructor makes things. Linear algebra would help. I will assume familiarity with Python (although it is an easy language to pick up). You will need to have some concept of machine learning. If you know about algorithms like logistic regression already, this book is perfect for you. If not, you might want to check out my \u201cprerequisites\u201d book, at: http://amzn.com/B01D7GDRQ2\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the other hand, this book is more like a casual primer than a dry textbook. If you are looking for material on more advanced topics, like LSTMs, convolutional neural networks, or reinforcement learning, I have online courses that teach this material, for example: https://www.udemy.com/deep-learning-c...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNew libraries like TensorFlow are being updated constantly. This is not an encyclopedia for these libraries (as such a thing would be impossible to keep up to date). In the one (1!!!) month since the book was first published, no less than THREE new wrapper libraries for TensorFlow have been released to make coding deep networks easier.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e", "custom_clean": 1, "custom_lists": [{"id": 1, "sort": "Programming.Python", "value": "Programming.Python"}], "custom_lists_ids": "1", "custom_read_date": null, "custom_reading_list": 1, "custom_types": "eBook", "flags": 1, "has_cover": 1, "id": 226, "identifier_ids": "842,843", "identifiers": [{"book": 226, "id": 843, "name": "Goodreads", "path": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29496091", "sort": "goodreads", "type": "goodreads", "val": "29496091"}, {"book": 226, "id": 842, "name": "Amazon", "path": "https://amazon.com/dp/B01CVJ19E8", "sort": "amazon", "type": "amazon", "val": "B01CVJ19E8"}], "isbn": null, "language_ids": "1", "languages": [{"avg_rating": 8.429245283018869, "count": 341, "id": 1, "name": "ENG", "sort": "ENG"}], "last_modified": "2023-07-21 18:05:25.156019+00:00", "order_by": "2022-10-08 20:04:04+00:00", "path": "Lazy Programmer/Deep Learning in Python_ Master Dat (226)", "pubdate": "2016-03-11", "publisher_ids": "117", "publishers": [{"avg_rating": 7.6, "count": 15, "id": 117, "name": "Independently Published", "sort": "Independently Published"}], "rating": 3, "series": [], "series_ids": null, "size": 208267, "tag_ids": "190,217", "tags": [{"avg_rating": 7.714285714285714, "count": 30, "id": 190, "name": "Programming", "sort": 30}, {"avg_rating": 7.714285714285714, "count": 9, "id": 217, "name": "Python", "sort": 9}], "timestamp": "2022-10-08 20:04:04+00:00", "title": "Deep Learning in Python: Master Data Science and Machine Learning With Modern Neural Networks Written in Python, Theano, and TensorFlow (Machine Learning in Python)"}, {"author_ids": "174,176,184", "authors": [{"avg_rating": 8.0, "count": 4, "id": 176, "name": "Jack Cohen", "sort": "Cohen, Jack"}, {"avg_rating": 9.166666666666666, "count": 86, "id": 174, "name": "Terry Pratchett", "sort": "Pratchett, Terry"}, {"avg_rating": 8.0, "count": 4, "id": 184, "name": "Ian Stewart", "sort": "Stewart, Ian"}], "comments": "\u003cdiv\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe fantastic first book in the Sunday Times bestselling Science of Discworld series\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen a wizardly experiment goes adrift, the wizards of Unseen University find themselves with a pocket universe on their hands: Roundworld, where neither magic nor common sense seems to stand a chance against logic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Universe, of course, is our own.
